In this video I'll demonstrate how to inflate a thin provisioned desk.

00:07.050 --> 00:13.320
So here you can see I have a virtual machine called test and if I click on the summary of this virtual

00:13.320 --> 00:22.920
machine we can see the VM hardware displayed here and this virtual machine has one hard disk a 40 gig

00:22.920 --> 00:29.970
hard disk and I can see to that that hard disk is currently in provision and it's located in my data

00:29.970 --> 00:31.490
store called big.

00:31.770 --> 00:39.270
So I'm going to go ahead and go to that data store called big and I'm going to look at the files that

00:39.270 --> 00:45.490
are present and you can see here for my virtual machine called test.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.650
There is a folder and within that virtual machines folder Here's my VMT OK.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.610
This is the actual virtual disk for this virtual machine.

00:54.720 --> 01:02.070
And it was a 40 gig virtual disk that is currently consuming 96 kilobytes of space.

01:02.070 --> 01:06.120
This is the beauty of the thin provision desk right.

01:06.120 --> 01:11.200
It consumes only the space that it actually needs.

01:11.250 --> 01:11.370
Right.

01:11.490 --> 01:12.940
And that's it.

01:12.960 --> 01:19.220
Now if I were to write quick this test at VMT K I could choose to inflate it.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.150
Right.

01:20.220 --> 01:28.520
And what the in-flight operation is going to do is it's actually going to take that VMT K and convert

01:28.520 --> 01:32.280
it to a thick provisioned V.M. decay.

01:32.580 --> 01:36.400
It's going to change it to a thick provisioned virtual disk.

01:36.450 --> 01:41.270
I'm just going to bring my recent tasks up here so we can see this happening.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.840
So it's good to change it to a thick provision desk.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.740
And this is going to take some time.

01:46.790 --> 01:47.250
Right.

01:47.360 --> 01:55.810
Because what it's basically doing is setting aside all of that disk space for that VMT OK.

01:55.920 --> 01:56.160
Right.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.060
Setting aside all of that physical disk space.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.380
So it's now going to chew up instead of you know 96 kilobytes.

02:03.630 --> 02:10.530
It's actually going to chew up something closer to 40 gigs which is the actual amount of disk space

02:11.100 --> 02:13.570
that we've granted to that virtual machine.

02:14.360 --> 02:14.800
Right.

02:14.820 --> 02:18.810
So again this operation is going to take a while you can see it's at 1 percent now.

02:19.020 --> 02:24.720
It's going to take a while to actually chew up and consume all that space and guarantee it to that VM.

02:24.720 --> 02:32.490
And as the inflate process is going you can see the results here that now we're consuming six hundred

02:32.500 --> 02:38.030
twenty five megs of space and as time goes on it will be consuming more and more.

02:38.130 --> 02:42.230
And so now we've lost the benefit of a thin provision.

02:42.360 --> 02:49.110
All right we're changing this virtual disk over to what's called the thick provisioned Eger zeroed disk.

02:49.560 --> 02:53.940
And you may be thinking at this point well why would I ever want to do that I'm wasting all of this

02:53.940 --> 02:55.320
space.

02:55.320 --> 03:02.960
Well the thing is a thick provisioned eager zero disk actually performs better for certain workloads.

03:02.980 --> 03:03.210
Right.

03:03.210 --> 03:10.410
So if you're running something like a sequel database or a Sharepoint server you may want to consider

03:10.410 --> 03:17.640
using a thick provisioned eager zero a desk because those really write intensive workloads work better

03:18.510 --> 03:20.060
on a disk that's eager Zira.
