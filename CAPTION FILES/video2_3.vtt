In this video I'll explain the role of the center the platform services controller and how they are

00:07.330 --> 00:11.320
used to manage our ESX I host.

00:11.450 --> 00:13.190
So here we see a little diagram.

00:13.220 --> 00:20.150
And basically the point of this diagram is to illustrate that the center is used to manage our entire

00:20.240 --> 00:22.240
vse fair environment.

00:22.410 --> 00:28.850
So in the big green box here that represented the center and then within it I might have multiple virtual

00:28.850 --> 00:38.210
data centers that include ESX hosts virtual machines data stores virtual switches and all of these different

00:38.210 --> 00:44.640
components that make up my virtual data center but the center is the top level of administration or

00:44.650 --> 00:53.400
I can use it to manage many ESX I host at once and resetter also hosts my Vee's for web client as well.

00:54.900 --> 01:01.560
So technically we could actually manage individual ESX I hosts using the Vee's for our client.

01:01.860 --> 01:08.300
But as the environment continues to grow this starts to become really impractical.

01:08.790 --> 01:15.090
So the center gives us that central management system so that we can control everything at once from

01:15.090 --> 01:24.630
one unified web client and not only does V Center give us our central management capability but it also

01:24.630 --> 01:26.910
makes certain features possible.

01:27.150 --> 01:33.780
You can't do commotions storage Wii motion high availability fault tolerance depress storage device

01:34.290 --> 01:43.950
and many other features require V Center to be available so visitors not just a management platform

01:44.190 --> 01:48.230
it unlocks a lot of capabilities that are not possible.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.520
If we choose to not deploy center

01:55.310 --> 02:01.550
so we have a few different options of how we can actually create our V Center server.

02:01.570 --> 02:10.650
There's the center server appliance or we can deploy the center on a Windows machine and the first option

02:10.920 --> 02:17.850
is to set up a Windows virtual machine and install the Center on it so we can install the center on

02:17.850 --> 02:22.160
top of any of the supported versions of Windows.

02:22.170 --> 02:25.230
This does require a Windows license of course.

02:26.310 --> 02:33.480
And because it's running on a virtual machine we can protect the center with either high availability

02:33.480 --> 02:34.740
or fault tolerance.

02:34.740 --> 02:41.890
So we can give ourselves the ability to recover from a failure of an ESX I host.

02:42.040 --> 02:50.540
Now we could also potentially deploy the center on a physical server running Windows.

02:50.690 --> 02:54.560
And this gives us complete segmentation of management.

02:54.680 --> 03:02.180
We've got our management server running on a separate physical device and this might be required for

03:02.180 --> 03:08.600
compliance purposes but it's usually not recommended because we can't protect the physical server with

03:08.600 --> 03:10.780
high availability or fault tolerance.

03:10.850 --> 03:15.270
So it doesn't have the same level of redundancy that a virtual machine would give us.

03:18.490 --> 03:25.630
Now an option that's becoming more and more popular is to configure a V Center server appliance and

03:25.630 --> 03:33.630
the center server appliance is a pre-built preconfigured virtual appliance that's designed to run V

03:33.640 --> 03:34.510
Center.

03:34.510 --> 03:43.830
Basically you download it you important to run on an ESX I host and you immediately have a complete

03:43.850 --> 03:45.440
the center configuration.

03:45.570 --> 03:51.120
That's very easy to install very easy to upgrade and it's a virtual machine that can be protected with

03:51.120 --> 03:54.260
high availability or fault tolerance.

03:54.480 --> 04:02.790
And we don't require a Windows license so traditionally the windows V Center has been more popular because

04:02.790 --> 04:11.280
it had a higher set of features it was compatible with additional databases it could support more virtual

04:11.280 --> 04:17.250
machines more ESX I host but now we have feature parity between the two.
