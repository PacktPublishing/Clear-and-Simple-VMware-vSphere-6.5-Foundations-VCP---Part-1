Zoning is a way that we can segment the fiber channel switch fabric.

00:05.110 --> 00:11.980
Let's say for example you have a storage array that's connected to a fiber channel switch and the storage

00:11.980 --> 00:15.080
array is dedicated to production data.

00:15.180 --> 00:21.810
Now hosts that are dedicated to the development team should not be able to access this array.

00:22.350 --> 00:27.330
So notice at the top left we have a dev ESX host at the bottom left.

00:27.330 --> 00:29.600
We have a Prod. ESX host.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.910
Maybe we only want to give the prod ESX host access to this fiber channel array.

00:37.640 --> 00:43.500
So we'll connect the prod ESX host to a port on the fiber channel switch fabric.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.700
That's part of the same zone.

00:46.470 --> 00:51.190
As the port that connects to the Fiber Channel array in this case I made a blue.

00:51.390 --> 00:55.360
So both the host and the array are connecting to port.

00:55.500 --> 01:01.860
Let's just call it the Blues-L whereas the dev ESX host is connecting to a port that's in the Green

01:01.860 --> 01:02.810
Zone.

01:03.660 --> 01:08.450
That means the VSX I host can't communicate with this fiber channel storage array at all.

01:08.640 --> 01:12.600
It's kind of like using the lands in an Ethernet switch.

01:12.600 --> 01:19.210
It's a way that we can logically segment and separate devices that are connected to the same switch.
