In this video I'll explain in independent hardware I scuzzy initiator.

00:06.020 --> 00:14.270
This is a solution that we can utilize in our ESX host to provide connectivity to an ice cold storage

00:14.270 --> 00:15.940
array over an Internet network.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.630
So let's take a look at how this works.

00:18.640 --> 00:23.250
Here we have a Windows virtual machine on the left with a virtual scuzzy controller.

00:23.380 --> 00:29.500
And as that virtual machine generates storage commands they flow out of the virtual scuzzy controller

00:30.070 --> 00:33.400
and they hit a physical storage adapter.

00:33.400 --> 00:41.590
Now in this case the physical storage adapter is an independent hardware Gazi initiator that has built

00:41.590 --> 00:49.280
in Ethernet ports so we don't require any sort of VM kernel port in this situation.

00:50.490 --> 00:55.110
The independent hardware I suppose the initiator is a complete hardware solution.

00:55.110 --> 01:00.110
We don't need a software I suppose the initiator identified we don't need VM kernel ports.

01:00.120 --> 01:07.710
It's got its built in Ethernet ports that we can use to connect directly to the storage network and

01:07.710 --> 01:13.260
the big benefit of the independent hardware I suppose the initiator is that it really leaves a lot of

01:13.260 --> 01:21.360
the storage workload from the ESX host it makes many of these storage operations independent of the

01:21.360 --> 01:25.120
current performance of the use of the ESX host.

01:25.140 --> 01:31.670
Now my storage has its own independent hardware that handles that workload.
