WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:05.220
In this video I'll demonstrate how to create a fair distributed switch.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.190
So here we are.

00:06.220 --> 00:13.380
And the Vee's for our web client and I'm going to click on the networking tab and under networking we

00:13.380 --> 00:18.990
should be able to see all of the virtual switches that have already been created in my inventory and

00:18.990 --> 00:24.930
you can see here we have two standard virtual machine groups.

00:25.020 --> 00:31.590
So that's what's been created so far to standard virtual switch networks that virtual machines can be

00:31.590 --> 00:32.960
connected to.

00:32.970 --> 00:36.160
I now want to create my Vee's for a distributed switch.

00:36.330 --> 00:43.470
So I'm going to go ahead and write click my training virtual data center and under distributed switch

00:44.190 --> 00:50.510
I'm going to create a new distributed switch and I'll call it demo.

00:50.770 --> 00:58.080
These a distributed switch or demo VDX and I'll hit next and I'm going to choose Vee's for a distributed

00:58.080 --> 00:58.530
switch.

00:58.530 --> 01:03.590
The current version which is compatible with VSE fair 6.5.

01:03.900 --> 01:10.830
I don't have any hosts that are on older versions of ESX II so I don't have to worry about using an

01:10.830 --> 01:12.810
older version of the distributed switch.

01:12.810 --> 01:21.270
However if I were to still have some ESX version 6 hosts in my environment or 5.5 hosts or things like

01:21.270 --> 01:25.100
that then I'd have to choose one of those older versions.

01:25.320 --> 01:31.470
I'm going to choose a version 6.5 and I'm going to set the number of playings as 4.

01:31.510 --> 01:38.410
I can always change that later on if I want to I'm going to leave network IO control enabled which is

01:38.470 --> 01:45.790
a way that I can use shares in Lovett's and reservations to control bandwidth contention and do I want

01:45.790 --> 01:48.370
a default port group YOUTZ go ahead and do that.

01:48.400 --> 01:58.360
And I'm going to call it distributed or dist switch PGE distributed switch porker just to make it easy

01:58.930 --> 02:01.560
to remember which is which.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.530
And I'll go ahead and hit finish here.

02:05.020 --> 02:09.200
And now my Vee's for distributed switches in the process of being created.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.220
And here it is.

02:10.690 --> 02:18.040
And on my vse for distributed switch I've got a port group and I've also got my uplinks here which at

02:18.040 --> 02:24.810
the moment I don't have any physical adapters that are dedicated to this Vee's for a distributed switch.

02:26.790 --> 02:31.010
So let's click on our VSD fear distributed switch.

02:31.040 --> 02:39.800
And over on the right I'm going to go to hosts and we can also see at the moment there are no ESX hosts

02:39.890 --> 02:43.010
associated with this Vee's for a distributed switch.

02:43.160 --> 02:48.090
So all right click the switch and go down to add and manage hosts.

02:48.620 --> 02:55.430
And I'm going to add some hosts and I'll hit next and I'll pick the two hosts that I already have in

02:55.430 --> 02:56.600
my environment.

02:57.720 --> 03:04.290
And I'm going to add these to the vees for a distributed switch and it basically just means that right

03:04.290 --> 03:09.340
now the VSE for distributed switch exists only within the center.

03:09.630 --> 03:09.930
Right.

03:09.960 --> 03:14.860
That's where all of the management and configuration of my Vee's fetish distributed it's is done.

03:15.180 --> 03:22.140
So right now I've created what we call the management plan where I can set up all of my poor groups

03:22.140 --> 03:26.310
I can do all my configuration but there's no data plane yet.

03:27.180 --> 03:34.550
This is for a distributor which is not capable of actually handling any traffic until I add some hosts

03:34.610 --> 03:37.690
and create that data plane.

03:37.740 --> 03:45.300
So by adding these hosts basically saying I want to push this vse very distributed switch configuration

03:45.570 --> 03:47.740
down to these hosts.

03:47.950 --> 03:50.800
I'll go ahead and hit next.

03:51.050 --> 03:57.820
And now I can choose some tasks that I may or may not want to perform as I'm adding these hosts.

03:57.860 --> 04:03.530
I'm not going to change any of my VM kernel ports and we will leave my management VM kernel poor write

04:03.620 --> 04:12.230
on the standard virtual switch but I do want to add some physical adapters and I do want to move some

04:12.230 --> 04:14.920
of my virtual machines.

04:15.150 --> 04:19.000
So I'm going to go ahead and hit next here.

04:19.110 --> 04:27.070
And so for my physical adapters I'll pick my first post here and on this host I've got some other some

04:27.120 --> 04:32.120
V.M. necks that are on other virtual switches that are unclaimed.

04:32.460 --> 04:39.330
Right on this virtual switch I have no physical adapters but on another virtual switch I have what's

04:39.330 --> 04:40.220
called VM zero.

04:40.230 --> 04:43.930
That's my physical adapter on that ESX host.

04:44.100 --> 04:50.930
And you can see at the moment my ESX I actually only have one physical adapter.

04:51.160 --> 04:56.230
So what I did in the background here was actually just pause my recording and it went to each of these

04:56.230 --> 04:59.140
hosts and I added another physical adapter.

04:59.140 --> 05:06.220
Right so now we can see that we have some other V.M. next V.M. neck one on each of these hosts.

05:06.310 --> 05:06.750
Right.

05:06.790 --> 05:15.080
And so what I'm going to do is go ahead and grab V.M. neck one on the first host and assign it to uplink.

05:15.080 --> 05:21.700
One of the V's for distributed switch and I'm going to do the same thing on the other ESX host and grab

05:21.700 --> 05:24.210
the next one assign it to uplink one.

05:24.590 --> 05:33.650
So what I've now done is assign one of the physical adapters on each of those ESX I hosts to my vees

05:33.680 --> 05:38.210
fair distributed switch and I'll go ahead and hit next.

05:38.220 --> 05:41.620
There is no impact on the existing configuration.

05:41.830 --> 05:47.020
That physical adapter wasn't even in use by any of the other virtual switches.

05:47.020 --> 05:51.090
And then my final option is to migrate VM networking.

05:51.090 --> 05:55.150
Right so I chose the option of migrating VM networking.

05:55.150 --> 06:01.000
And so I'm going to take this test VM and I'm going to hit assign port group and I'm going to move it

06:01.000 --> 06:04.020
over to the distributed switch port group.

06:04.020 --> 06:10.810
Right and if you expand here you can see the source port group right now is on internal.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.770
And the destination port group is the distributed switch port group.

06:14.770 --> 06:17.400
I'm not going to mess with my center server appliance.

06:17.410 --> 06:24.850
I'm going to leave that on the network that it's currently on and I'll go ahead and hit next and finish.

06:24.910 --> 06:34.150
And so now what I've done is I've actually gone ahead and configured the very distributed switch on

06:34.160 --> 06:36.410
two of my ESX I host.

06:36.540 --> 06:44.870
And if we kind of take a moment to move back over to hosts and clusters and we examine this first ESX

06:45.050 --> 06:51.400
host and we go to configure and other networking we look at virtual switches.

06:51.470 --> 06:57.350
Now we see we have our demo Vee's fair distributed switch available here.

06:57.350 --> 07:02.780
We can see that we have one virtual machine distributed switch port group and we can see that we have

07:02.780 --> 07:10.760
one physical adapter configured and assigned to this Vee's for a distributed switch and this particular

07:10.760 --> 07:11.510
host.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.430
And if we look at the other host we'll see something very similar.

07:15.440 --> 07:22.070
We've got the demo Vee's for distributed switch and we've got one physical adapter assigned at the moment.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.310
There is no virtual machines connected to this.

07:25.460 --> 07:32.610
These very distributed switch on this particular host though one other thing that I want to point out

07:32.610 --> 07:34.630
to you before I move on.

07:34.710 --> 07:36.970
Notice on this host.

07:36.990 --> 07:41.700
I'll call it host 13 and host 13 of the demo vees for distributed switch.

07:41.730 --> 07:49.070
And I vse with 0 8 which is a standard switch on host 12.

07:49.070 --> 07:58.670
I have the demo VDX I switch 0 and I have another standard virtual switch.

07:58.870 --> 08:05.830
And remember the standard virtual switches are local to one specific ESX I host so that the switch wan

08:05.830 --> 08:08.380
will not be present on the other ESX I host.
