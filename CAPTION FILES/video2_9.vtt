In this video I'll explain content libraries and how they can be used to share content such as templates

00:09.850 --> 00:18.580
and virtual appliances across multiple Center instances content libraries were introduced with the center

00:18.590 --> 00:28.120
sex and it's basically a repository of things like templates and ISO images as well as virtual appliances

00:28.140 --> 00:30.970
or Olivier files.

00:31.130 --> 00:37.660
You can have a content library that is specific to just a single center instance if you'd like.

00:38.090 --> 00:44.120
So if you're not setting up linked mode or hybrid linked mode and you don't have modal VSAN or instances

00:44.720 --> 00:46.960
content libraries can still be useful.

00:49.540 --> 00:53.390
But they can also be published and can be subscribed to.

00:53.440 --> 01:01.600
So if you create a content library in one sound or server and you put in a bunch of templates then you

01:01.600 --> 01:03.270
can go to another B center server.

01:03.310 --> 01:10.480
Subscribe to that content library and have access to that same collection of ISO images templates and

01:10.480 --> 01:11.860
virtual appliances.

01:13.760 --> 01:21.260
So this allows us to share a common set of templates ISOs in virtual appliances across multiple be separate

01:21.260 --> 01:22.670
instances.

01:22.670 --> 01:24.200
So heres step.

01:24.350 --> 01:34.750
We will create a content library in one of our V Center inventory's and then optimally will have multiple

01:34.900 --> 01:41.710
centers and hybrid linked mode even though its not necessarily a requirement in order to share a contact

01:41.710 --> 01:42.380
library.

01:42.580 --> 01:48.750
What we'll do is then publish the content library on the source VI Sandersen room.

01:48.990 --> 01:56.490
And when we do that it will provide us with a link that we can distribute for any other Center instances

01:56.490 --> 02:03.330
that we want to allow to subscribe to that content library and then we simply go to the destination

02:03.330 --> 02:04.610
the center server.

02:04.890 --> 02:11.550
We go ahead and we add a content library and we specify that we want to subscribe to any existing content

02:11.550 --> 02:15.080
library and provide that you are around.

02:15.310 --> 02:17.330
And it's really just as simple as that.

02:17.530 --> 02:24.730
And on each side you'll have a data store that serves as the repository for all of that content.

02:24.970 --> 02:29.620
So the two sides will synchronize with each other and you'll have an identical collection of templates

02:29.980 --> 02:34.440
ISO images and virtual appliances at both locations.

02:34.450 --> 02:40.480
I want to include a demo with this course as well so if you want to see a content library creation in

02:40.480 --> 02:45.340
action go ahead and watch a demo and that will give you a really good idea of exactly how to create

02:45.340 --> 02:46.290
these and manage them.
