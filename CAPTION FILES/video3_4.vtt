00:01.550 --> 00:07.910
In this video we'll learn about some of the features that can be provided with VSE for standard and

00:08.090 --> 00:15.370
fair distributed virtual switches and some of these features are unique to the distributed switch on

00:15.380 --> 00:16.510
the.

00:16.570 --> 00:20.080
So with these fare there's two different types of virtual switches.

00:20.190 --> 00:27.330
The standard virtual switch comes with all licensing additions and it has a basic feature set where

00:27.330 --> 00:35.070
as the VSE for a distributed switch has an enhanced feature set and is only available with the Enterprise

00:35.070 --> 00:37.590
plus licensing addition.

00:37.620 --> 00:43.530
So I'd differentiate between the two as we go through all of these features and learn about them.

00:43.830 --> 00:54.180
And the first feature that we're going to talk about here is discovery protocols either CTP or LDP CTP

00:54.190 --> 01:03.370
stands for Cisco discovery protocol and LDP stands for a link layer discovery protocol and these are

01:03.370 --> 01:09.470
useful features that have been around for a long time on physical networking hardware.

01:09.650 --> 01:17.570
These discovery protocols are used for is to learn information about other networked devices that are

01:17.570 --> 01:21.710
connected like for example in our little diagram here.

01:21.710 --> 01:27.770
Assume that this ESX host has a standard switch.

01:28.100 --> 01:35.150
So if you get the first standard switch configured on the ESX host and that Vee's first standard switch

01:35.150 --> 01:41.810
has some physical connections to a Cisco switch a physical switch.

01:42.710 --> 01:51.230
We can configure Cisco discovery protocol to allow it to discover some of the characteristics of the

01:51.230 --> 01:52.650
physical switches cell.

01:52.760 --> 01:57.110
We're going to allow it to learn information about the physical switch.

01:58.290 --> 02:07.080
Things like the IP address of the switch things like which physical adapter is connected to what physical

02:07.080 --> 02:08.290
switch port.

02:08.310 --> 02:15.180
So VM neck zero is connected to you know a physical switch port 0 1 VM Nic one is connected to switch

02:15.180 --> 02:20.400
port 0 slashed to right and that can help us to make sure that we don't accidentally unplug the wrong

02:20.400 --> 02:21.060
cable.

02:22.740 --> 02:32.340
So that CTP Cisco discovery protocol and that is a Cisco specific discovery protocol that is available

02:32.340 --> 02:40.170
on of these fair standards which LDP is basically the exact same thing.

02:41.330 --> 02:44.900
Except for it's not a Cisco specific technology.

02:44.910 --> 02:45.230
Right.

02:45.280 --> 02:52.070
Al LDP stands for a link layer discovery protocol and it's only supported on the Vee's for distributed

02:52.070 --> 02:55.420
switch but it does basically the exact same thing.

02:55.460 --> 03:01.120
It just allows you to discover information about the other devices on the network.

03:01.370 --> 03:10.220
When we're using a VSE fair distributed switch we can create traffic marking and traffic filtering policies.

03:10.220 --> 03:18.950
So for example we could create a filtering policy for some incoming traffic from a certain IP address

03:18.950 --> 03:22.110
range or a certain TCAP port.

03:22.210 --> 03:27.760
And when that traffic hits the Vee's for a distributed switch the vees for distributed switch will take

03:27.760 --> 03:36.360
the specified action maybe dropping the packet or we could even have it take certain actions like assigning

03:36.550 --> 03:44.510
a class of service or DCP tags to provide quality of service on our outgoing traffic.

03:44.700 --> 03:49.920
So as this traffic is leaving the virtual switch and heading to the physical network we can set up a

03:49.920 --> 03:55.680
policy in the Vee's for a distributed switch to create these class of service or quality of service

03:55.680 --> 03:56.480
tags.

03:56.850 --> 04:04.210
And then as that traffic hits the physical network it will actually respect the quality of service values

04:04.210 --> 04:11.920
that we've appended So that's traffic filtering and tagging is basically an access list and the virtual

04:11.920 --> 04:18.620
switch that can drop or accept certain types of traffic or can apply quality of service values.

04:19.540 --> 04:22.650
And again in this course we cover this at a very basic level.

04:22.660 --> 04:26.360
I just want you to be familiar with the features that are available.

04:26.380 --> 04:33.250
We don't really get into how to configure a lot of these features or a lot of the very detailed specifics

04:33.250 --> 04:35.320
about how these features operate.

04:35.320 --> 04:39.880
We just want you to be aware of the features that are available and what they do.

04:42.990 --> 04:45.550
So another good feature is network health check.

04:45.570 --> 04:49.570
Again this is something that's supported only on the VSE for distributed switch.

04:49.740 --> 04:52.640
And basically here's what network health check does.

04:52.830 --> 04:59.250
You can run a network health check in the Vee's for a web client and what it will do is it will compare

04:59.280 --> 05:05.340
the configuration of your vse fair distributed switch like really critical configuration items like

05:05.340 --> 05:11.310
with the MT You are what's the next teaming method or the veel and configuration and it'll compare those

05:11.310 --> 05:19.040
configurations to how the physical switches configured and tell you if there are inconsistencies that

05:19.040 --> 05:22.410
you can easily identify and fix.

05:22.430 --> 05:29.660
So that's the purpose of network health check is to validate the configuration of the fair distributed

05:29.660 --> 05:33.550
switch against the configuration of a physical switch.

05:34.660 --> 05:40.650
NET flow is a nother feature that's only supported on a VSE fair distributed switch.

05:40.750 --> 05:47.860
What it basically does is it tracks all of the traffic that's going on in your environment and it sends

05:47.860 --> 05:54.880
reports to a centralized server where it's kind of like a kid that tells on all his friends and then

05:54.880 --> 05:57.960
at 4:00 there is like the mom that he's telling on them with.

05:58.270 --> 05:58.500
Right.

05:58.540 --> 06:04.450
So for example let's say that you know we have a virtual machine that sends some traffic to an e-mail

06:04.450 --> 06:05.050
server.

06:05.200 --> 06:05.610
Right.

06:05.860 --> 06:13.040
Well what will happen with net flow is the virtual switch will actually track that traffic and it'll

06:13.060 --> 06:20.140
send a little report to this net flow collector saying hey you know $10 one out of 11 just talked to

06:20.140 --> 06:24.900
this e-mail server over port 80 and here's how much traffic it sent.

06:25.030 --> 06:30.730
And this allows the net flow collector Whether it's like what's up gold or solar winds or any of those

06:30.730 --> 06:31.880
options.

06:31.930 --> 06:39.850
It allows the net flow collector to build up a detailed historical record of all the traffic that's

06:39.850 --> 06:48.100
occurring on this network so that if you need to do forensic analysis or figure out you know traffic

06:48.100 --> 06:52.630
patterns over time or maybe have an issue that occurred like one o'clock people said everything was

06:52.630 --> 06:58.690
slow all night and go into that outflow collector and look at what was happening at one o'clock and

06:58.690 --> 07:02.060
you'll have a nice historical record of all of the traffic occurring.

07:02.230 --> 07:04.120
And that's the purpose of net flow.

07:04.120 --> 07:10.570
Again this is something that's been around forever and the physical network and the VSE for a distributed

07:10.580 --> 07:20.520
switch can be configured for net flow and can send these reports to an outflow collector and the last

07:20.520 --> 07:24.120
feature we're going to talk about here is Port mirroring.

07:24.120 --> 07:31.910
So port mirroring can be used to send a copy of all the traffic on one port to another port.

07:31.920 --> 07:39.780
So for example let's say that this traffic is flowing in and it's destined for one of these virtual

07:39.780 --> 07:47.280
machines where we can set up a port mirroring session to say any traffic for this particular ports should

07:47.280 --> 07:50.030
also be mirrored to this other port.

07:50.190 --> 07:57.360
Right so maybe what I want to do is put a sniffer or put you know wireshark or something running on

07:57.360 --> 07:58.610
this second port.

07:58.710 --> 08:02.740
So that I can monitor all the traffic that's actually hitting the first port.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.000
That's what port mirroring is used for.

08:05.070 --> 08:11.390
And there's all sorts of different port mirroring session types that you can set up.

08:11.400 --> 08:17.130
Again we do more in the other vse for our courses we kind of get a little deeper on those things for

08:17.130 --> 08:20.250
the purposes of the VM or certified associate.

08:20.370 --> 08:26.160
What you need to know is port marrying is a way to take all of the traffic that's occurring on one port

08:26.790 --> 08:33.690
and send an identical copy of that traffic to some destination usually another port on a distributed

08:33.690 --> 08:34.280
switch.

08:35.300 --> 08:41.880
OK so let's take a moment to review in this lesson we learned about Cisco discovery protocol and blinkered

08:41.880 --> 08:48.530
Clair discovery protocol and how they can be used to discover information about other network devices.

08:49.540 --> 08:55.690
We learned about net flow and how it can be used to send historical traffic records to a centralized

08:55.690 --> 09:03.940
collector so that we can analyze historical traffic patterns and do things like forensic analysis or

09:03.970 --> 09:08.440
determine the root cause of intermittent performance issues.

09:11.190 --> 09:17.010
We learned how traffic filtering and marking can be used on the VSE for distributed switch to do things

09:17.010 --> 09:23.260
like drop certain types of traffic or apply quality of service tags to certain types of traffic.

09:23.340 --> 09:30.180
And we learned how Portmeirion can be used to take traffic that's occurring on one port and send a mirrored

09:30.180 --> 09:31.570
copy of it to another port.
