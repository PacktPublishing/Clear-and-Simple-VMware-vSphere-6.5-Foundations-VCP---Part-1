00:00.960 --> 00:05.340
In this video we'll learn a little bit about getting your VM Ware certification.

00:05.370 --> 00:11.130
Now you're here to learn about the topics related to the Vee's fear six top five foundations exam and

00:11.130 --> 00:14.060
here receive more certification home page.

00:14.130 --> 00:21.480
And if we browse to data center virtualization here you can see the requirements to get a certification

00:21.660 --> 00:23.480
and data center virtualization.

00:23.970 --> 00:29.440
And so what we're primarily concerned with here is things above the associate level.

00:29.580 --> 00:33.050
You can get the VM or certified associate as well.

00:33.050 --> 00:39.390
That's kind of an entry level certification but if you're taking the Wiis for 6.5 foundation exam you're

00:39.390 --> 00:45.210
probably looking to achieve a professional level certification.

00:45.270 --> 00:47.140
So let's focus on that.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.460
The VCP 6.5 data center virtualization.

00:51.780 --> 00:57.720
And if we take a look at the requirements here if you're new to where data center virtualization if

00:57.720 --> 01:05.250
you don't have any existing certifications you have to number one attend to one of their required training

01:05.250 --> 01:06.180
courses.

01:06.180 --> 01:10.950
Now there are a couple of ways around that that I'll talk about in a little while but if you're brand

01:10.950 --> 01:16.990
new to VM or certification you have to attend one of their classes and official the where of course.

01:17.190 --> 01:23.910
And then you have to pass the vees first 6.5 Foundation's exam and that if you want to move on from

01:23.910 --> 01:27.730
there you have to pass the VCP exam as well.

01:27.750 --> 01:34.140
Now if you have already had training from V.M. where you don't need to take another class as long as

01:34.140 --> 01:42.570
it's been for 6.00 training and if you already have a current valid VCP 5 or VCP 6 You don't even need

01:42.570 --> 01:44.170
the foundation's exam.

01:44.190 --> 01:52.500
Now that being said there are some ways around this if you want to get your VCP sex in a different track

01:52.740 --> 01:58.940
like network virtualization there are some little ways that you can go around the requirement to attend

01:58.990 --> 02:02.030
an official V.M. or class.

02:02.040 --> 02:08.800
So here we see the network virtualization track and let's just take a quick look at the VCP 6 dash and

02:08.880 --> 02:14.880
exam and you can see for that particular exam if you're going for a network virtualization you have

02:14.880 --> 02:17.410
to pass the Vee's for six foundations exam.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.630
And of course the VCP exam as well.

02:20.470 --> 02:26.140
But if you already have a CNA you don't actually need to attend an official Villamor class.

02:26.320 --> 02:30.110
So there are a couple of ways around that official course requirement.

02:30.430 --> 02:35.780
So let's take a look at the first six five foundations exam.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.290
Here we see some information on the exam itself.

02:38.290 --> 02:44.900
It's 105 minutes long with 70 questions and the price for the exam is one hundred twenty five dollars

02:45.490 --> 02:48.980
and you can simply click on the link to schedule an exam.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.850
That's not really what I want to look at here.

02:50.860 --> 02:54.450
We want to look at the exam guide.

02:54.620 --> 02:59.850
So this is going to break down exactly what you can expect to see on the certification test.

02:59.900 --> 03:04.490
And I'll tell you about the exam and I'll tell you about what you need to know in order to pass the

03:04.490 --> 03:05.690
exam as well.

03:05.840 --> 03:13.560
And here we can see all of those exam objectives you'll find all of this content is covered in the first

03:13.790 --> 03:17.650
five foundations part 1 and Part 2 courses.

03:17.650 --> 03:23.590
So once you've completed those courses and you're ready to move on to the Wii's fair 6.5 foundations

03:23.590 --> 03:26.710
exam I would recommend completing a practice test.

03:27.440 --> 03:33.770
So here you can see a sample of the first five foundations practice exam that I've published on you

03:33.770 --> 03:34.410
to me.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.470
I would suggest going through this.

03:36.470 --> 03:44.720
There's 120 questions and they're very closely aligned to what you can expect to see on the VM or certification

03:44.720 --> 03:45.140
test.

03:45.140 --> 03:48.400
So I'm just going to choose a couple random answers here in hand next.

03:48.650 --> 03:51.440
And you can see it's going to just take you through all of these questions.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.260
And if we skip all of the way to the end.

03:54.800 --> 04:01.100
When you complete the exam you'll have the opportunity to review the questions that you got wrong many

04:01.100 --> 04:07.830
of which are accompanied by an explanation and links to external resources.

04:07.890 --> 04:12.220
So the exams are really going to help you solidify that knowledge.

04:12.540 --> 04:17.790
So if you want to take these you can reach out to me for a promo code or you can just go to you to me

04:18.240 --> 04:24.050
and search for research 6.5 foundations practice test and you'll find it.

04:24.070 --> 04:30.180
And finally I just want to make sure that everybody is aware that when you go ahead and try to passivist

04:30.180 --> 04:37.420
for 6.5 foundations exam there are two parts to this course and part 1 and Part Two as well as the practice

04:37.420 --> 04:39.020
tests that I just mentioned.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.770
So you should complete part one complete part two.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.790
Go ahead and complete the practice test.

04:43.900 --> 04:49.240
And then another great step would be to complete some hands on laps and you can find a lot of great

04:49.240 --> 04:56.170
free hands on labs and Shoval that VM where dot com if we click on the launch button here you can see

04:56.170 --> 04:59.770
some of the free labs that are available.

04:59.980 --> 05:06.670
Things like V.M. or Cloud Foundation or build your own software defined datacenter and you can see here

05:06.700 --> 05:13.450
all of the counts of different types of labs that are available for all of these different VM Ware products.

05:13.450 --> 05:19.750
If you're focused on VSE for you want to go to software defined data centers and here you can see all

05:19.750 --> 05:25.420
kinds of topics related to V.M. whereas vizir and one of the good ones you might want to start with

05:25.690 --> 05:28.880
is introduction of Vee's fair and what's new.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.030
These first six out five What's new.

05:31.030 --> 05:36.910
These are some great hands on labs that will definitely help you build that knowledge that you need

05:37.000 --> 05:38.820
in order to pass the exam.

05:38.830 --> 05:44.650
So I strongly recommend completing a few of these hands on labs as well just to help you get some real

05:44.650 --> 05:48.880
hands on experience to go with all of the courses that you've just completed.
