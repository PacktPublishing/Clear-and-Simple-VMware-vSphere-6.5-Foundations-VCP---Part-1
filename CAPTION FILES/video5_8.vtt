00:01.820 --> 00:07.700
In this video I'll explain snapshots and how we can successful use them and we'll also talk about some

00:07.700 --> 00:12.420
of the disadvantages of snapshots and potential issues that they can cause.

00:12.730 --> 00:19.180
But first and foremost what is a snapshot Well here we see a virtual machine.

00:19.240 --> 00:25.120
And at this moment this virtual machine has certain programs running it has contents of memory.

00:25.120 --> 00:33.920
It's also got a virtual disk and a snapshot is used to take a point in time picture of a virtual machine.

00:34.150 --> 00:41.030
So let's say for example on this virtual machine we need to perform some sort of update and we want

00:41.030 --> 00:46.690
to give ourselves a fallback point just in case something goes wrong with this update.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.740
And this virtual machine is powered on.

00:48.870 --> 00:57.360
So there's information currently in memory and also there's the contents of data that are stored on

00:57.360 --> 00:59.690
my virtual disk.

00:59.790 --> 01:05.620
Now when we take a snapshot a new file is created called the VM Mesan file.

01:05.880 --> 01:11.980
And in this file the current contents of memory are stored.

01:12.020 --> 01:17.830
So now we have half of our point and time picture of this virtual machine.

01:17.900 --> 01:24.450
The other thing that we need to capture is the current contents of the virtual disk the other thing

01:24.450 --> 01:30.420
that happens when we take a snapshot is that this virtual disk or VM decay is going to be marked as

01:30.420 --> 01:40.170
read only this ensures that no changes will be made to the data on this virtual disk and it will be

01:40.170 --> 01:45.690
preserved exactly as it was when we took our Snapshot.

01:45.690 --> 01:51.830
So when the original virtual disk is locked a new Delta disk is created.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.700
And remember this is a running VM.

01:55.750 --> 02:01.640
So now that the original disk is Read-Only we need somewhere to write changes to.

02:01.930 --> 02:08.200
So that Delta disk is going to be where all of our live data rights go moving forward.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.970
So those are the components that get introduced when you take a snapshot.

02:15.270 --> 02:21.060
And now we have our backout point right now we have a point and time picture of exactly what was going

02:21.060 --> 02:24.150
on in this virtual machine at a given moment in time.

02:25.310 --> 02:28.640
And let's say that our software update doesn't go so well you know.

02:28.650 --> 02:34.010
Now maybe we need to revert back to this snapshot we need to fall back to that fallback point that we

02:34.010 --> 02:34.750
created.

02:35.730 --> 02:44.100
If we decide to revert to a snapshot the contents of that VMA file are restored to memory now the contents

02:44.100 --> 02:48.820
of memory are exactly as they were when we took that snapshot.

02:50.230 --> 02:56.440
The Delta that VM decay is discarded because we don't need those changes that have been made since the

02:56.440 --> 03:03.260
snapshot we want to revert to our virtual disk the way that it was when that snapshot was taken.

03:03.550 --> 03:09.510
So the original VM decay is simply unlocked and is no longer read only.

03:09.610 --> 03:15.520
And now our virtual disk is exactly back to the way it was and our contents of memory are exactly as

03:15.520 --> 03:17.530
they were when we took that snapshot

03:22.960 --> 03:27.370
However snapshots are not without their limitations.

03:27.370 --> 03:34.590
So for example let's go back to this V.M. And again the virtual machine is running and it has a single

03:34.590 --> 03:36.090
virtual disk.

03:36.210 --> 03:42.470
And when we take our Snapshot the contents of memory are captured in that vehemence and file the VMT

03:42.630 --> 03:48.910
is marked as read only and the new Delta that VMT is created and moving forward.

03:48.990 --> 03:53.070
That's where all live right of data occur.

03:54.480 --> 04:00.590
Well what do you think will happen if we leave that snapshot in place for weeks and months.

04:01.630 --> 04:08.890
That Delta disk will get bigger and bigger and bigger and eventually we may decide that we don't actually

04:08.890 --> 04:10.480
need this snapshot anymore.

04:10.480 --> 04:15.040
Let's say it's been three months and we finally decided to delete this snapshot.

04:16.330 --> 04:23.620
This means that the last three months of changes are all located on that Delta disk and we can't just

04:23.620 --> 04:25.280
throw all that data away.

04:26.170 --> 04:32.800
When we delete the snapshot all of that data needs to get copied back to the original VM DK.

04:35.570 --> 04:39.650
So as we delete the snapshot the VM Ehsaan file is no longer needed.

04:39.860 --> 04:45.530
There's no point in hanging on to the contents of memory at the time of the snapshot so the VM isn't

04:45.530 --> 04:47.380
files simply perched.

04:48.020 --> 04:56.480
Then the original VM DK will be unlocked and all of the changes that have occurred since that snapshot

04:56.480 --> 05:01.560
was taken will now need to get committed to that original VM.

05:01.560 --> 05:12.350
DK This can be time consuming and it can also cause the size of this virtual disk to temporarily expand

05:12.740 --> 05:15.710
while that copy operation is in progress.

05:15.710 --> 05:23.040
It may actually consume more space on the data store than it normally does.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.610
One other side note.

05:24.910 --> 05:28.660
At times deleting a snapshot can take a very long time.

05:28.810 --> 05:34.480
If you've left the snapshot out there for an extended period it may take a long time for that snapshot

05:34.480 --> 05:35.650
to delete.

05:35.650 --> 05:41.070
Just be aware that once you start deleting a snapshot you cannot cancel that process.

05:41.080 --> 05:47.170
Also be aware that you cannot shut down a reboot that virtual machine while the snapshot deletion is

05:47.170 --> 05:47.860
occurring.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.440
So what do we take away from all of this.

05:53.450 --> 05:56.780
Well a snapshot is a point in time picture of a virtual machine.

05:56.780 --> 06:02.570
It captures the exact state of the VM at that moment but it is not a backup.

06:02.570 --> 06:10.730
It should not be retained long term when a snapshot is taken that original VM is now marked as read

06:10.730 --> 06:18.770
only to preserve the contents of the virtual disk exactly as they are and all live changes will now

06:18.770 --> 06:24.780
go to a Delta that VMT K when the snapshot is deleted.

06:24.780 --> 06:31.630
All of those changes that are in the doubt that VMT K must now be committed back to the original VM

06:31.630 --> 06:40.030
DK snapshots are useful for short term needs such as creating a fallback point before making a change.

06:40.030 --> 06:45.880
I personally have a policy that I will never leave a snapshot in my environment for more than one week

06:46.330 --> 06:52.210
because at that point the Delta file can become very large and it can become more and more difficult

06:52.330 --> 06:53.500
to delete that snapshot.
