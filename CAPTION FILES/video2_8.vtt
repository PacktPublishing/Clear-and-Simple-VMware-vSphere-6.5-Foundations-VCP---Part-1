00:00.390 --> 00:06.450
In this video we'll look at some of the basic configuration for an ESX host and we really have two ways

00:06.450 --> 00:09.110
that we can go about configuring a host.

00:09.120 --> 00:09.340
Right.

00:09.350 --> 00:15.180
We can come into the these for web client go under the configure tab and set up all sorts of things

00:15.180 --> 00:17.730
like storage and virtual switches.

00:17.730 --> 00:21.210
We can do our licensing configuration.

00:21.360 --> 00:25.460
We can do time configuration and all of this sort of stuff.

00:25.830 --> 00:34.220
But what I think I'm actually going to do is demonstrate this using the host client.

00:34.620 --> 00:41.190
So here I've pointed my browser to the IP address for my ESX I host itself and I'm going to go ahead

00:41.190 --> 00:46.530
and log in directly to this host and we can do a lot of the basic settings here.

00:46.530 --> 00:48.130
So under manage.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.360
Let's take a look at what we can do for the system.

00:51.510 --> 01:00.530
We have settings like autostart do we want virtual machines to automatically start when the ESX host

01:00.540 --> 01:01.410
starts.

01:01.410 --> 01:06.540
And so I'm going to go ahead and use Yassar and I'm going to give it a certain amount of delay so maybe

01:06.540 --> 01:12.680
I'll say you know what let's wait a few minutes here before we actually start up for our machines and

01:12.690 --> 01:14.250
when this host starts up.

01:14.940 --> 01:18.360
And then if we're shutting down the host maybe we want them to stop.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.610
So I'm going to go ahead and enable auto start.

01:21.990 --> 01:26.680
And that's one option we can pick the host swap location.

01:26.810 --> 01:27.180
Right.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.400
So let's take a look at these configurations.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.440
Do we want to enable host swap.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.730
Do we want to pick a specific data store.

01:35.430 --> 01:41.120
And here's something that you'll probably want to configure the A.P. client right.

01:41.150 --> 01:44.740
So let's edit settings on our network time protocol.

01:45.180 --> 01:52.590
I'm going to set it up so that NTPC will automatically start when the ESX host starts and I'm going

01:52.590 --> 01:57.170
to put in the IP address of my anti-peace.

01:57.870 --> 02:01.560
And go ahead and hit save here.

02:01.570 --> 02:08.770
And so now I'm going to refresh the status and I'm going to actually go into actions and start the anti-peace

02:08.770 --> 02:14.140
service and make sure that this works successfully OK.

02:14.250 --> 02:16.110
So now a.p is enabled.

02:16.110 --> 02:22.920
It's running and this ESX host is going to get its time from this anti-peace server.

02:23.090 --> 02:29.380
So those are some of my basic system settings that we can configure under hardware.

02:29.380 --> 02:34.530
We can see all the devices we can also see the power management policy as well.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.400
We're using a balanced policy.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.380
We're going to just leave that at the defaults.

02:38.380 --> 02:44.200
Here's my enterprise plus license key if I want to assign a different license I can do that here by

02:44.200 --> 02:46.680
clicking on the sign license.

02:46.900 --> 02:53.920
You can see all of the features that are included with this license key down below the license key itself

02:55.100 --> 02:56.850
under packages.

02:57.080 --> 03:03.200
Here we can see all of the updates and packages that have been installed and their services we can stop

03:03.230 --> 03:07.720
and start the different services that are running on the ESX I host.

03:08.090 --> 03:14.690
So for example let's say that we wanted to disable or enable S-sh.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.860
Here's the S-sh service.

03:17.420 --> 03:22.030
I can go ahead and start that service or I can stop that service.

03:22.820 --> 03:25.540
So I have the ability to start and stop any of these services here.

03:25.710 --> 03:30.290
So you can see right now A.P. is running right I just started that service

03:34.860 --> 03:37.570
finally under security and users.

03:37.590 --> 03:45.010
Let's go to authentication at the moment my ESX host has not been joined to an Active Directory domain.

03:45.060 --> 03:53.640
I can do that if I'd like to and by joining the host to the domain I can now allow individuals to log

03:53.640 --> 04:01.770
in to the host and manage it using their domain credentials instead of the root password.

04:01.770 --> 04:03.980
So this is a security best practice for sure.

04:05.480 --> 04:11.540
Then under users we can see the users for this particular host if I'd like to I can add individual users

04:11.540 --> 04:18.650
like Mad Men or whatever the name I want to give it and I can add passwords here and that will allow

04:18.650 --> 04:23.940
me to have users locally authenticate to this particular ESX I host and manage it.

04:24.220 --> 04:30.960
And if I want to I can assign different levels of permission to those users.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.460
Well we can see that under rules.

04:33.620 --> 04:38.440
So here are the different roles that are available.

04:38.690 --> 04:46.180
And then I can also configure a lockdown mode so at the moment lockdown mode is disabled.

04:46.580 --> 04:55.550
If I choose to enable strict lockdown mode what that is going to do is it is going to force any management

04:55.580 --> 04:58.690
of this host to come through the center.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.480
I won't be able to launch this host client that we're using right now.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.730
That won't work.

05:03.980 --> 05:10.760
I won't be able to launch the direct console user interface or DC UI on this host that'll be locked

05:10.760 --> 05:12.040
down too.

05:12.110 --> 05:20.090
So if I enable strict lockdown mode the only way to manage this host is through the center.

05:20.250 --> 05:26.190
And if the sender has some sort of catastrophic failure or something like that I'm probably going to

05:26.190 --> 05:34.800
end up rebuilding this ESX host versus normal lockdown mode which enables management through the center

05:35.220 --> 05:36.770
and the DC UI.

05:37.110 --> 05:43.050
So I'll still be able to access the local console of those hosts and manage them that way.

05:44.610 --> 05:50.890
I'm going to leave lockdown mode disable now because at the moment I don't need that any.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.840
You can also use the host client to do things like add data stores and you can see a couple of data

05:55.840 --> 06:02.020
stores that we've added here I can create new data stores I can manage my storage adapters and do things

06:02.020 --> 06:09.650
like add a software I scuzz the initiator and I can see all the ones that my host has access to.

06:09.910 --> 06:11.830
And I can manage my networking as well.

06:11.850 --> 06:16.580
Right here we can see the different groups that are available to the host.

06:16.600 --> 06:25.790
I can see my virtual switches that are available physical Next all the VM kernel ports and I can even

06:25.790 --> 06:30.470
modify some firewall rules and this is an important security step here.

06:30.470 --> 06:30.770
Right.

06:30.770 --> 06:43.010
So I know that in my particular environment the only DNS server is on the 192 dot 168 that 199 address

06:43.010 --> 06:44.380
range.

06:44.600 --> 06:50.090
So if I'd like to I can come in here to the firewall and I can say the DNS client is only going to be

06:50.090 --> 07:02.430
allowed to connect to 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 9 9 0 slashed 24 and now I've created a firewall rule that is essentially

07:02.430 --> 07:04.510
securing DNS right.

07:04.980 --> 07:11.520
So this is definitely a security best practice to come in here modify all of these firewall settings

07:12.240 --> 07:16.050
to only allow the appropriate address ranges.

07:17.410 --> 07:23.350
And switched back to open wide because this is just my lab environment and I'm not too worried about

07:23.350 --> 07:23.720
it.

07:26.950 --> 07:32.390
And then finally the other thing that we can do in the host client is manage our virtual machines.

07:32.500 --> 07:38.630
So I can go find one of my VM I can right click it and edit the settings on the VM.

07:38.650 --> 07:44.920
I can power them off I can power them on I can change all of my VM options here so you can manage all

07:44.920 --> 07:48.180
your virtual machines from this individual host client as well.
