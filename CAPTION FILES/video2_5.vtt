WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:08.990
So here you can see I've downloaded the center server appliance ISO and I got this from my VM where

00:08.990 --> 00:09.800
dot com.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.040
And so I've downloaded the ISO.

00:12.200 --> 00:17.450
I've already actually extracted the files to a folder here called VSE.

00:18.050 --> 00:26.930
And within this folder I'm just going to browse to the CSA UI installer go to Win32 and I'm going to

00:26.960 --> 00:33.730
go ahead and launch the installer make full screen and I'm going to install I'm going to install a new

00:33.730 --> 00:38.310
V Center server appliance.

00:38.540 --> 00:44.090
Now before I even go on here let's close the installer and go back real quick because there's a number

00:44.090 --> 00:46.410
of different options that are presented here.

00:46.430 --> 00:46.940
Right.

00:46.940 --> 00:52.970
Like I could migrate from an existing center server for Windows to visit our server appliance I could

00:53.000 --> 00:56.210
upgrade an existing V Center server appliance.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.640
I'm going to choose to do a fresh install here.

00:58.670 --> 01:01.370
That's the process that I want to demonstrate.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.360
And so I'm going to deploy a new virtual appliance.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.020
So I'll go ahead and choose next I'll accept the license agreement.

01:08.170 --> 01:11.900
You know basic stuff here and then I'll choose the deployment type.

01:12.010 --> 01:21.160
And in this case I don't believe I'm going to have multiple Center instances that I want to use a shared

01:21.200 --> 01:25.750
a platform services controller for I'm only going to have one V Center server.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.520
And so for me it makes sense to go with an embedded platform services controller.

01:30.520 --> 01:37.300
But if you were to have multiple Center instances then you might want to consider going with an external

01:37.300 --> 01:39.290
platform services controller.

01:39.310 --> 01:49.270
So I'll go with the embedded I'll choose next and I'm going to put in the IP address or the end of my

01:49.270 --> 01:50.490
ESX host.

01:50.500 --> 01:55.490
So let's grab that.

01:55.490 --> 02:01.580
So here I am in my VM or workstation environment and you can see here I've got a bunch of virtual machines

02:01.580 --> 02:06.070
running one of which is a virtual ESX I host.

02:06.140 --> 02:12.320
So I'm going to go ahead and grab the IP address of that ESX I host so that I have a target to send

02:12.320 --> 02:14.920
this Vee's center virtual appliance too.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.450
I mean this is going to be a virtual machine.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.460
So it needs to run on some yes Exide host.

02:21.590 --> 02:27.800
So my ESX host is going to be 192 168 dot 199 dot 11

02:32.190 --> 02:33.760
so I put my IP address.

02:33.810 --> 02:39.660
I'll put in my username which is Route my password go hadn't hit next.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.990
That's probably going to kick out a certificate warning.

02:41.990 --> 02:45.170
Yup I'm going to go ahead and just hit Jess here.

02:48.450 --> 02:53.840
And now I'm going to set up my appliance virtual machine so I'm going to name the virtual machine.

02:53.850 --> 02:57.460
V c s a dash lab.

02:57.660 --> 03:03.440
And I'm going to make my root password something that I can definitely easily remember.

03:03.990 --> 03:06.360
And now it's going to have me choose the deployment size.

03:06.390 --> 03:09.680
So how many ESX I hosts.

03:09.690 --> 03:14.290
Am I going to be dealing with how many ESX I host as is the center need to support.

03:14.370 --> 03:16.870
How many Reems how much.

03:17.220 --> 03:23.250
How much memory in s.p use are going to be assigned really depend on the amount of hosts and VAMC that

03:23.250 --> 03:25.130
this environment needs to support.

03:25.260 --> 03:32.930
So I'm going to go with the tiny deployment size and the default storage size and I'll hit next and

03:32.930 --> 03:39.080
you'll notice here that my installer Lague kicked out an error in saying I don't have enough memory

03:39.080 --> 03:42.020
on the host for the selected profile.

03:42.020 --> 03:49.340
So I'm guessing my virtualise ESX host doesn't actually have enough memory 10 gigs to support this virtual

03:49.340 --> 03:49.840
machine.

03:49.880 --> 03:55.370
So I'm going to go make a quick change there and then we'll come back here and we'll try it again.

03:55.820 --> 04:03.140
OK so I paused my recording and I actually changed the amount of memory on that ESX host and I also

04:03.140 --> 04:09.460
freed up some space in my storage to accommodate the swap file for this VM.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.960
So let's try it again.

04:11.630 --> 04:18.480
And on this screen I'll choose the data store that my visa under virtual machine will be stored on.

04:18.710 --> 04:22.920
And now we'll go ahead and assign it some addressing information.

04:23.060 --> 04:30.200
So I'm going to give it a static IP address and I'm going to provide it with a system name as well which

04:30.200 --> 04:34.480
is going to be the either the QTL or IP address of the system name.

04:34.490 --> 04:44.320
I'm going to call it the C as a lab is going to be the name of it.

04:44.330 --> 04:51.270
And I of course have to put in the fully qualified domain name so I'll call it VC I say dash lab dot

04:51.360 --> 05:04.700
lab local and I'll go ahead and put in the IP address that I'm going to use 9 2 1 6 8 1 9 9 21 and my

05:04.700 --> 05:10.580
subnet mask will be 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 0.

05:10.580 --> 05:17.810
It's throwing a warning here basically telling me that the key d'Ayen of the system name is not resolvable

05:17.810 --> 05:19.800
to this IP address.

05:19.850 --> 05:20.650
That's OK.

05:20.670 --> 05:34.470
I'm going to go with 1 9 2 1 6 8 8 1 9 9 1 for the default gateway and DNS server 1 2 2 1 6 8 1 9 9

05:34.950 --> 05:35.500
4.

05:35.510 --> 05:40.310
Now of course in your environment you know these addresses are all going to be different.

05:40.340 --> 05:45.030
And even if you've built your own home lab you're probably going to have some different addresses.

05:45.260 --> 05:50.620
Some of the problems that I'm having with DNS and stuff like that is because the DNS server set up in

05:50.630 --> 05:56.170
my lab environment not on this particular PC that I'm recording this class.

05:56.180 --> 06:01.770
So when I deployed as we sent our share replied into the lab it should work just fine.

06:02.120 --> 06:07.500
And here gives me all of the details of the configuration that I've created.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.880
So I'm going to go ahead and hit finish.

06:10.100 --> 06:15.740
And this is the part that's going to take a pretty long time especially because in my environment my

06:16.070 --> 06:19.470
large data store that I'm storing this in is very slow.

06:19.700 --> 06:26.160
So I'm going to pause the recording and allow this suppliants to complete the point.

06:29.870 --> 06:30.630
All right.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.940
So that took about 15 minutes in my live environment.

06:34.190 --> 06:40.480
But my installation of my V Center server appliance is complete.

06:40.580 --> 06:48.110
So I'm going to go ahead and close the installer here and what it's telling me is to complete the installation

06:48.110 --> 06:48.860
process.

06:48.860 --> 06:56.060
Stage 2 I need to go to the web interface the V Center server appliance itself.

06:56.090 --> 07:04.940
So here we can see I've used the web browser to successfully go ahead and open up the web interface

07:04.940 --> 07:07.390
to my new Wii center server appliance.

07:07.610 --> 07:11.810
And now from here I need to continue on with my configuration.

07:12.080 --> 07:18.320
So I'm going to choose to set up a V Center server appliance and I'll go ahead and I'll put in my my

07:18.320 --> 07:20.580
route credentials here.

07:21.520 --> 07:26.290
Log in and I'll begin stage two or actually set up the central server appliance.

07:26.290 --> 07:30.500
So here's all the configuration settings that I currently have.

07:31.330 --> 07:38.060
In this case I'm going to use synchronize with the ESX I host for the time synchronization method.

07:39.090 --> 07:43.060
Just because I don't have an A.P. server set up in my lab environment.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.710
So I'll just go with that and then I'll go ahead and hit next.

07:50.110 --> 07:52.620
And it's saving some of the configuration changes.

07:52.640 --> 07:58.100
If you run into any errors here make sure that you know your DNS server is up and running and working

07:58.100 --> 07:59.360
properly.

07:59.360 --> 08:05.240
That's usually the most common cause of problems here is that the Sanish I was unable to communicate

08:05.240 --> 08:15.040
with DNS now will create my single sign on administrator I don't want to join the customer experience

08:15.040 --> 08:20.740
improvement programs so I'm going to check that out next and I'll just validate all of my settings here

08:20.740 --> 08:24.130
which all look great and I'll go ahead and finish.

08:24.370 --> 08:27.030
And once this process starts you can't stop it.

08:27.040 --> 08:31.360
Essentially what that message there was is telling me.

08:31.470 --> 08:36.930
All right so we can see it now I have successfully deployed my center server appliance.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.780
And at this point it's ready to go.

08:39.780 --> 08:46.770
So for all of you home lab users out there what I'm going to do now kind of behind the scenes here is

08:46.770 --> 08:52.590
I've created this new Wii center server appliance I'm actually going to use it to replace my existing

08:52.860 --> 08:55.180
windows V Center in my home lab.

08:55.350 --> 09:02.670
So I'm going to do is I'm going to actually deploy this new virtual machine as an overlay and then import

09:02.670 --> 09:04.890
it into my VM or workstation inventory.

09:05.040 --> 09:11.700
And that's a pretty straightforward way to allow you to kind of build this VM on one of your lab ESX

09:11.700 --> 09:19.320
I hosts but then kind of take it out of that lab environment and run the center virtual machine directly

09:19.320 --> 09:21.020
on VM or workstation.
