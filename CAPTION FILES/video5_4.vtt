00:00.290 --> 00:09.710
In this video I'll demonstrate how to create a V-Amp so V-Amp is simply a container for a group of related

00:09.710 --> 00:10.780
virtual machine.

00:11.910 --> 00:17.310
So I'm going to click on this ESX host I should say I'm going to right click on this ESX I host and

00:17.310 --> 00:21.540
I'm going to go to new Wii app and I'm going to create a new app.

00:21.610 --> 00:21.920
Right.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.290
So you get to create a new Wii app I'll hit next.

00:24.550 --> 00:25.930
And this is really straightforward.

00:25.930 --> 00:30.620
I'm going to call it trainer test dot com.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.170
Ty tier app.

00:33.350 --> 00:40.200
Right so we've got some kind of multi-tier application that requires multiple virtual machines.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.650
And I'll go hadn't hit next here.

00:43.120 --> 00:50.920
And what I'm going to do at this point is configure the resource allocation settings for this Wii app

00:51.370 --> 00:53.850
so the app is a container.

00:54.160 --> 01:02.890
I'm going to drag and drop multiple virtual machines into this app and they will all share the resources

01:03.190 --> 01:11.710
of the app so I may want to give this virtual appliance high number of shares or a high number of memory

01:11.710 --> 01:19.210
shares or maybe I want to do something different like maybe I say hey this app I need to set a memory

01:19.210 --> 01:23.350
limit on this thing just so it doesn't get completely out of control.

01:23.350 --> 01:23.650
Right.

01:23.650 --> 01:30.790
So I'll set up a 1 gig memory limit on this or I can configure these resources and they will be applied

01:31.090 --> 01:35.950
to the group of virtual machines that are contained within this V-Amp.

01:36.220 --> 01:37.590
Just like a resource pool.

01:37.830 --> 01:38.500
OK.

01:38.590 --> 01:45.530
So I had to get rid of that memory limit and I'll hit next and I'll finish.

01:45.530 --> 01:52.250
So those resource controls are very much the same as you would get with the resource pool.

01:52.250 --> 01:57.890
So now that I've successfully created my Wii app I'm going to start to drag and drop some of my virtual

01:57.890 --> 02:02.350
machines into the Wii app and you can simply drag and drop right.

02:02.360 --> 02:08.740
It's easy to do in the Wiis for web client just simply click on them and drag them up to the train or

02:08.770 --> 02:11.640
testate multi-tier app.

02:11.760 --> 02:17.230
And now I've got three virtual machines contained within the app.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.990
So now you can start to do the really cool stuff here.

02:20.220 --> 02:28.160
Right click this Wii app and I'm going to go to edit settings and let's say this is a multi-tier application

02:28.170 --> 02:30.730
so I need my database to start first.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.420
I need my app to start second.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.690
And indeed my web server to start Third while I can do that.

02:36.920 --> 02:37.270
Right.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.680
So you can see here the order that it's been put in.

02:39.720 --> 02:45.450
I'm actually going to change this order real quick of my app up move my web down and what's going to

02:45.450 --> 02:57.620
happen is Group 1 is going to boot up first and group 2 will only boot up once either 120 seconds have

02:57.710 --> 03:05.450
elapsed or when VM Ware tools are ready this virtual machine.

03:05.550 --> 03:08.290
So that's that's the configuration I'm going to do.

03:08.520 --> 03:15.090
And then group two will then start booting up and once group two has had 120 seconds or maybe I make

03:15.090 --> 03:19.090
it 240 seconds write whatever I need to do there.

03:20.080 --> 03:25.500
That group of virtual machines will be given some time to boot up and then group 3.

03:25.540 --> 03:29.590
And so that's really the biggest use case for a Wii app.

03:30.030 --> 03:30.230
Right.

03:30.270 --> 03:36.850
Is to control power on and power off order for a multi-tier application.
