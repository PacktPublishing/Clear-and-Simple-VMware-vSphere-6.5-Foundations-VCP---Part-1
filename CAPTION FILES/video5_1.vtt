00:00.790 --> 00:05.020
In this video I'll demonstrate how to clone a virtual machine.

00:05.960 --> 00:14.540
So I'm going to start by simply grabbing this app VM and right clicking it and under the app VM I have

00:14.540 --> 00:20.440
the option to clone this virtual machine either to a template or to another virtual machine.

00:20.450 --> 00:23.230
So I'm going to clone it to another virtual machine.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.780
I'm going to call it a wreck.

00:25.870 --> 00:26.350
The

00:29.040 --> 00:33.000
quote the name of my virtual machine.

00:33.270 --> 00:34.820
I'll go ahead and hit next.

00:36.140 --> 00:40.860
And I'm going to pick an ESX host for this clone to run on it.

00:40.890 --> 00:47.570
Next one more time I'll choose the virtual desk format which is going to be thin provision.

00:47.610 --> 00:53.330
In this case I'm going to put up my big data store I'll hit next.

00:53.510 --> 00:57.740
And at this point I'm going to choose a couple options here or I'm going to choose to customize the

00:57.740 --> 00:59.330
guest operating system.

00:59.750 --> 01:03.830
I'm going to choose to customize the virtual machines hardware and I'm going to choose the power on

01:03.830 --> 01:07.050
this VM after it's done being created.

01:07.220 --> 01:16.520
So to customize the guest operating system I can now choose one of my customisations specs.

01:16.520 --> 01:24.730
And if you watched my video on templates you saw me create this customization spec all of the Windows

01:24.730 --> 01:32.320
settings that need to be unique like Exidy like the computer name like the IP address they're all specified

01:32.320 --> 01:34.240
within this customisation spec.

01:34.570 --> 01:42.850
So when I clone this VM all of its settings are going to be scrubbed within windows and made unique

01:45.770 --> 01:49.580
and the virtual machine will actually automatically join the domain as well.

01:49.580 --> 01:50.550
The new virtual machine.

01:50.550 --> 01:56.060
Well as long as my customization spec has those domain credentials.

01:56.060 --> 01:58.700
And then they can change the virtual hardware right on my clone.

01:58.700 --> 02:04.550
So if I want my clone to have more memory or if I want my clone to have to sleep use instead of one

02:05.000 --> 02:09.410
and maybe I want to give it less virtual disk space I can change all these options.

02:09.410 --> 02:12.850
Actually I can't give it less virtual desk space and give it more.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.870
I can't make the virtual disks smaller.

02:17.020 --> 02:19.760
And at that point I can just hit next and I'm ready to complete.

02:19.930 --> 02:25.570
And if I hit finish we can monitor the progress and recent tasks actually have some other cloning operations

02:25.570 --> 02:27.310
going on right now as well.

02:27.340 --> 02:31.750
But here you can see the cloning operations that have just kicked off.

02:31.870 --> 02:37.570
And so I'm going to have another virtual machine call the rick Creasey app clone that's exactly the

02:37.570 --> 02:44.050
same as app except for it's going to go through the windows customization process.

02:44.290 --> 02:48.490
So it will have a unique ID and unique computer name and an all that good stuff.
