WEBVTT

00:00.990 --> 00:06.650
In this video we'll take a look at some of the new V Center features that are available with these first

00:06.840 --> 00:13.500
five and the first big feature that I want to take some time to examine is called the center server

00:13.500 --> 00:16.400
high availability.

00:16.430 --> 00:22.610
This is a really important new feature because what it does is it gives you the ability to protect the

00:22.610 --> 00:26.460
center server with just native built in tools.

00:26.480 --> 00:26.710
Right.

00:26.710 --> 00:33.800
So this takes away a lot of the requirements that we've had in the past for things like V Center heartbeat

00:34.400 --> 00:35.350
and stuff like that.

00:35.360 --> 00:35.540
Right.

00:35.540 --> 00:43.860
This is a really great system that we can use to just use integrated availability for the center server.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.630
So let's start by breaking down our diagram here.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.280
So on the far left we have our active V Center server.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.740
This is the center server that's running right now.

00:55.760 --> 01:02.120
And let's assume that it's got an embedded platform services controller and we're using the V Center

01:02.120 --> 01:03.220
share of our appliance.

01:03.290 --> 01:03.720
Right.

01:04.490 --> 01:11.410
So we've got our activity center instance it's got the embedded postscripts sequel database.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.250
It's got the IP address of the V-sign or instance present on it.

01:16.310 --> 01:24.750
And then we've also got a passive v. center and a witness appliance and the role of the witness is to

01:24.750 --> 01:26.950
provide quorum.

01:26.960 --> 01:33.160
So what I mean by that is if there is some sort of scenario where we have a failure.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.150
And so a failure occurs.

01:35.150 --> 01:39.190
Well we could have all kinds of different failures.

01:39.290 --> 01:45.230
There could be all sorts of different failures that could occur and it might not be apparent as to which

01:45.230 --> 01:46.820
recentre is actually working.

01:48.010 --> 01:53.890
For example let's say that if something were to break the network connection between the active and

01:53.890 --> 02:00.810
passive the center well that point the witness will basically provide quorum right I'll say I can reach

02:00.810 --> 02:06.060
this via sender but I can't reach this other Center.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.530
It's almost like a voting system.

02:08.530 --> 02:11.280
So the majority rules in this case right.

02:11.290 --> 02:17.110
So if the witness and the passivist owner can talk to each other at that point the passivist is going

02:17.110 --> 02:24.620
to take over and that's the role of the witness in this case is to essentially provide a tiebreaker

02:26.270 --> 02:28.130
between the active and passive the center

02:32.610 --> 02:37.850
so it's going to happen in this scenario is the active the center and the passivist center.

02:37.860 --> 02:42.080
They are going to synchronously replicate their database.

02:42.300 --> 02:46.280
And what that means is they're going to replicate in real time.

02:46.280 --> 02:46.470
Right.

02:46.470 --> 02:50.020
They're going to be constantly kept exactly the same.

02:50.190 --> 02:57.130
So any time you hear the term synchronous replication that's what that means it's just simply real time

02:57.140 --> 02:58.760
a replication of data.

02:58.830 --> 03:02.580
We need to keep these two centers exactly the same.

03:02.580 --> 03:11.930
So we're going to replicate the database from the act of the center to the paths of the center.

03:11.930 --> 03:15.760
All right so now let's assume some sort of failure has occurred.

03:15.770 --> 03:16.010
Right.

03:16.010 --> 03:24.190
Maybe the ESX I host that the activity center was running on has failed or maybe the data store that

03:24.220 --> 03:27.790
that active V Center had its files stored on has failed.

03:29.460 --> 03:35.090
That's one of the beautiful things about this system is it does not assume that we have shared storage.

03:35.100 --> 03:41.530
It assumes that the active data center could potentially be housed on local storage.

03:41.530 --> 03:48.000
All right so if that's the case if the activity center was on the local disks of 7 ESX I host and those

03:48.000 --> 03:57.280
disks failed or the scuzzy controller failed or something like that we it would go out but that's okay

03:57.310 --> 04:04.380
because we've been constantly replicating this database from our primary center to our passively center.

04:04.390 --> 04:08.260
So it has an up to date copy of all of the data that it needs.

04:08.260 --> 04:13.360
And at this point the passive Center and the witness have a quorum.

04:13.570 --> 04:18.640
They know that the primary Senator the one that was active was now down.

04:18.670 --> 04:20.950
So there's a fail over that that occurs.

04:20.950 --> 04:30.220
And at that point the passive sender becomes the active the center it takes over the IP address of the

04:30.280 --> 04:37.360
active center and it's got a current copy of the database on both of these instances.

04:37.540 --> 04:40.110
So it has a current copy of all of the data.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.930
Right it also has a set of files that need to be replicated.

04:43.990 --> 04:49.480
So every virtual machine has a set of files like VM X Files and things like that.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.860
Those files also need to get replicated and those happen once every five minutes.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.240
OK so now the passivist Center has taken over.

05:01.270 --> 05:07.260
It's now running the databases now got the current IP address the fail over time here is five minutes.

05:07.260 --> 05:08.840
The recovery time objective.

05:09.030 --> 05:17.160
So any time you hear that term r t o r t o means recovery time objective and that's simply the amount

05:17.160 --> 05:18.780
of acceptable downtime.

05:18.950 --> 05:25.290
So visitors are going to be down for about five minutes for this fail fail over to occur.

05:25.400 --> 05:35.480
The RPO or recovery point objective is zero recovery point objective specifies how much data can we

05:35.480 --> 05:38.510
lose how much data loss is acceptable.

05:38.510 --> 05:42.990
How many minutes of data can we tolerate losing.

05:43.330 --> 05:48.080
And in this case it's zero because the database is being replicated synchronously.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.680
So there is no data loss.

05:52.800 --> 05:58.380
So that's the biggest new feature of the center in these first 6.5.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.080
It's fairly straightforward to configure this.

06:01.080 --> 06:06.780
You can go through what's called the Basic workflow and that makes it very easy to set up the basic

06:06.780 --> 06:10.540
workflow is just like it sounds it's extremely basic.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.030
It's basically a point and click tool.

06:13.560 --> 06:20.790
It's automatically going to create those passive nodes in the witness nodes it's automatically going

06:20.790 --> 06:24.840
to create distress anti affinity rules.

06:24.840 --> 06:32.340
So you don't have to worry about any of that but if you want to do something more specific to your particular

06:32.340 --> 06:39.780
needs like spread nodes across multiple host clusters spread nodes across multiple physical locations

06:40.320 --> 06:44.480
then you need to use the advanced deployment workflow.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.700
And that's a little bit more complicated.

06:49.270 --> 06:55.500
It's also more complicated if you're using an external platform services controller.

06:55.500 --> 07:02.450
Right because we need to provide high availability for the platform services controller as well.

07:03.290 --> 07:11.960
So we'll provide ha for the platform services controller using a load balancer maybe from you know F5.

07:12.050 --> 07:18.530
They have a big IP as their big load balancer or if you have the more NSX there's a load balancer included

07:18.530 --> 07:20.360
with that that you can use as well.

07:20.810 --> 07:26.570
But regardless if you decide to do an external platform services controller and usually you're only

07:26.570 --> 07:29.380
going to do that if you have multiple The center server.

07:29.750 --> 07:35.180
But if you decide to go that route setting up the center server ha becomes a little bit more complicated

07:35.570 --> 07:37.520
because we need to utilize a load balancer

07:41.760 --> 07:48.790
Another new feature in for six top five is the native backup and restore of the center.

07:48.810 --> 07:50.120
Great new feature.

07:50.130 --> 07:57.060
It allows us to back up the center and the platform services controller from the center appliance management

07:57.060 --> 07:59.420
interface or VME.

07:59.730 --> 08:06.030
So the center appliance management interface is simply that little web address on port 54 80 that you

08:06.030 --> 08:09.710
connect to that allows you to manage the center server appliance.

08:09.920 --> 08:10.360
Right.

08:10.440 --> 08:16.380
Or we can also kind of go the new direction here with all of these vees fair tools and use the API to

08:16.380 --> 08:28.850
set up a native backup that we can send these backups using Sep using FCP or SFP are using HDP or GDP.

08:29.080 --> 08:36.210
So we can use secure encrypted methods and you can also encrypt the backup as well if you want.

08:36.230 --> 08:38.290
And then finally what about our clients.

08:38.310 --> 08:45.620
Well many of you will be sad to find out that there is no more C-Sharp client support than the old thick

08:45.650 --> 08:49.210
client is no longer supported.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.760
That's a little bit of bad news for you.

08:51.830 --> 08:59.180
We still have the VSE faire web client which is the flash based the sphere web client and you can access

08:59.180 --> 09:03.830
using a web browser but there is some big improvements here.

09:03.830 --> 09:06.140
And number one it's faster.

09:06.240 --> 09:10.490
And number two you don't need that client integration plug in anymore.

09:10.620 --> 09:19.320
So in VSE for sex you had to install a client integration plug in if you wanted to do things like deploy

09:19.740 --> 09:29.340
virtual appliances IVF or over a virtual appliances You need of the client integration plug in to upload

09:29.340 --> 09:35.380
a file to a data store or to import or export items from a content library.

09:35.520 --> 09:40.230
So basically if you were going to run the Vee's for web quite you probably were going to need that client

09:40.230 --> 09:43.990
integration plug in that's no longer required.

09:44.130 --> 09:53.170
There is still a plugin available called the Enhanced plugin and the enhanced plug in is specifically

09:53.170 --> 09:56.380
for Windows pass through authentication.

09:56.650 --> 10:02.410
So if you're logging into the vees for a web client and you want it to automatically grab your current

10:02.410 --> 10:03.760
Windows credentials.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.400
You still need to plug in for that.

10:05.470 --> 10:10.500
And that's called the Enhanced plug in.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.810
We also have the T.M. L5 V-Star climb.

10:15.050 --> 10:17.280
They simply call this the VSE for our client.

10:17.280 --> 10:22.980
Now the age Tim L5 version of the he's very quiet and that's definitely the future direction.

10:23.010 --> 10:29.360
You know that and the API the future direction that we're headed here at some point the flash based

10:29.360 --> 10:31.560
web client is going to be deprecated.

10:31.580 --> 10:38.450
We're not there yet because the HVM L5 client still doesn't have all the features that the Flash version

10:38.450 --> 10:39.140
does.

10:39.140 --> 10:45.910
So we're not quite to the point where we can completely abandon that flash HVM quiet.

10:46.220 --> 10:50.050
But the future direction is definitely this HMO L5 client.

10:50.390 --> 10:53.820
We've also got the V Center appliance management interface.

10:53.840 --> 11:01.070
So if you connect to the V Center server appliance over port 54 80 This will give you some of the basic

11:01.190 --> 11:07.430
administrative tools for the VSE that are server appliance things like you know network settings and

11:07.460 --> 11:09.630
updates and stuff like that.

11:09.650 --> 11:17.230
We also have the VM where host client this is used to connect to individual ESX hosts and it's an eight

11:17.230 --> 11:19.100
team L5 tool.

11:19.490 --> 11:26.320
So this replaces that C-Sharp client that we use to use to connect to individual ESX hosts.

11:26.310 --> 11:33.410
We're now transitioning to an HDMI five based tool called VM or host client.

11:33.530 --> 11:36.630
And then finally we've got rest API eyes right.

11:36.680 --> 11:43.540
And these rest API is our programmatic interfaces that we can use integrate with VSE fair.

11:43.550 --> 11:52.580
This is definitely the long term future direction here is both the best API and HVM L5 based tools that

11:52.580 --> 11:58.300
don't require flash or any kind of browser specific considerations.
