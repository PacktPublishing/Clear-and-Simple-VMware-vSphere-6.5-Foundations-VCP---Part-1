This video I'll give you a basic explanation of the different licensing editions that are available

00:08.340 --> 00:14.590
with Vee's for and I'm just on the via my web site to take a look at the different licensing editions

00:14.590 --> 00:16.000
available here.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.320
So let's scroll down a little bit.

00:18.370 --> 00:24.280
And by the way if you want to find this web site just go to Google and type in Vee's for licensing editions

00:24.610 --> 00:26.210
and you'll find this.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.300
And here we have the different licensing editions.

00:28.300 --> 00:34.280
We've got Wiis first standard and vse for enterprise Plus are the two that I really want to focus on.

00:34.870 --> 00:41.980
So with these first standard and Vee's for enterprise Plus there are different features supported with

00:42.010 --> 00:50.070
each of these additions like for example both additions support storage Wii motion these very data protection.

00:50.470 --> 00:52.490
Here's a good example of a difference.

00:52.600 --> 00:58.920
This first standard only supports fault lines for virtual machines with two virtual C-p use whereas

00:58.930 --> 01:02.800
enterprise plus supports virtual machines with four virtual use.

01:02.920 --> 01:08.470
And so there's a number of these little differences here virtual machine encryption is not supported

01:08.470 --> 01:09.690
by vse for standard.

01:10.030 --> 01:18.520
And a lot of these resource control type tools like Diyar ass storage depress storage IO control network

01:18.520 --> 01:26.680
IO control these things are not supported by the VSE standard licensing edition.

01:26.780 --> 01:33.080
So you need to be aware of some of the basic features that are not supported by Standard and some of

01:33.080 --> 01:39.860
the critical ones are distributed switches host profiles and the two or three that I just mentioned

01:39.860 --> 01:46.310
up here Diyar ass and storage DRM storage are cultural and network IO control.

01:46.310 --> 01:54.350
Those are some really important ones to understand are not supported by vse for standard.

01:54.460 --> 01:59.450
And if we keep on scrolling down there's a couple of other licensing additions as well.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.240
We've got the.

02:02.340 --> 02:07.350
And there's also some other features like if you want to see the business continuity features of each

02:07.350 --> 02:11.340
licensing edition we can see those in availability.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.280
We've also got these for essentials.

02:14.280 --> 02:23.610
Licensing model so essentials supports a maximum of three ESX I hosts essentially Plus again a maximum

02:23.610 --> 02:31.490
of three ESX I host with two processors each essential Plus does come with a number of features though

02:32.010 --> 02:39.960
provided by the center like the motion high availability for data protection endpoint and these for

02:39.960 --> 02:41.370
replication.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.560
So those are different licensing options.

02:43.560 --> 02:51.360
And if you scroll a little further down it starts to break down the cost per processor of each.

02:51.360 --> 02:58.590
And there's also of course going to be no pricing required for maintenance as well.

02:58.620 --> 03:05.040
So always bear that in mind as well in real life if you're purchasing these for licensing you're probably

03:05.040 --> 03:07.920
going to have to purchase a support contract as well.
