00:00.070 --> 00:06.360
In this video I'll demonstrate how to install ESX I 6.5 from an ISO image.

00:06.360 --> 00:08.940
Now there's a few different ways you can do this in real life.

00:08.940 --> 00:09.150
Right.

00:09.150 --> 00:14.960
You could use a DVD or you could use auto deploy or a scripted installation.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.450
In this case I've simply downloaded the ISO switch from VM Moore's website and I'm actually going to

00:21.450 --> 00:27.790
install ESX II on a virtual machine and I'm going to do this using VM Ware workstation.

00:27.870 --> 00:34.020
I'm going to create a new virtual machine and I'm going to actually install ESX I'm on this virtual

00:34.020 --> 00:40.470
machine so I'm going to go ahead and hit Next here and I'm going to tell it I'll install the operating

00:40.470 --> 00:41.270
system later.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.810
I'm going to do that using my iso image.

00:44.370 --> 00:50.810
And in this case I'm just going to choose ESX I 6 but we're actually going to install ESX I top five

00:50.880 --> 00:59.820
so I'm going to call it ESX I 6:5 demo and I'm going to choose the appropriate disk where I have some

00:59.940 --> 01:02.370
extra room to put this VM

01:09.560 --> 01:10.880
in I'll hit next.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.980
I'll choose the number of processor cores we'll stick with two.

01:14.230 --> 01:17.650
I'm going to give it a gigs of memory.

01:18.220 --> 01:25.600
I'm going to use network address translation to provide my virtual machine with a IP address and I'm

01:25.600 --> 01:30.940
going to choose a new virtual disk I'm going to make it 20 gigs in this case just to keep it a little

01:30.940 --> 01:32.810
smaller.

01:33.160 --> 01:38.760
And here's my VM DK It's going to exist for this virtual machine.

01:38.950 --> 01:40.180
I'll choose customize hardware.

01:40.180 --> 01:42.010
Here's the important part right.

01:42.030 --> 01:50.640
I've got a CD DVD drive for this VM and I'm going to go ahead and use an ISO image file.

01:50.650 --> 01:55.410
All right so I'm going to browse to my ESX host ISO image.

01:55.420 --> 01:56.560
Let's see where it is.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.420
VM visor installer 65.

01:59.460 --> 02:05.760
I'll go hit open here and I'll make sure that I've selected connected power on.

02:05.770 --> 02:11.680
All right so when I power on this new virtual machine it will boot from the iso image that I've specified

02:12.010 --> 02:14.120
and I'll go ahead and have finish.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.230
OK.

02:15.370 --> 02:20.470
So in real life you're probably going to have a physical host or you're probably going to have some

02:20.470 --> 02:25.920
sort of media like a DVD or US B media that you're actually going to boot from.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.760
In this case it's a little bit different.

02:27.790 --> 02:28.120
Right.

02:28.130 --> 02:35.250
I'm booting up a virtual machine and installing ESX high on it now isn't powering up this virtual machine.

02:35.250 --> 02:38.370
It's telling these are some very movable devices that I can get rid of.

02:38.370 --> 02:39.260
I'm just going to go ahead.

02:39.290 --> 02:40.310
OK here.

02:40.840 --> 02:47.410
And so here we see that we actually have ESX II being installed right.

02:47.590 --> 02:54.280
So this virtual machine is booting from my ESX high ISO image and now it's going to go ahead and take

02:54.280 --> 02:57.110
us through the ESX eye installation process.

02:57.550 --> 02:59.890
So I don't really need VM or workstation anymore.

02:59.890 --> 03:05.860
I'm just going to go ahead and bring this full screen and this part is going to actually take a little

03:05.860 --> 03:06.330
while.

03:06.640 --> 03:11.430
It's going to go through and load up everything it needs to install ESX.

03:11.740 --> 03:14.860
So I'm going to speed up this recording here.

03:15.070 --> 03:20.290
And so when it comes back we'll take a look at what we need to do to actually complete the installation

03:20.290 --> 03:21.200
process.

03:23.570 --> 03:29.930
OK so here we are at the first prompt of our ESX installation wizard I'm going to go ahead hit enter

03:30.560 --> 03:37.130
to continue and that's 11 to accept the licensing agreement.

03:37.250 --> 03:37.780
OK.

03:37.970 --> 03:41.840
And in this screen it's just asking me what virtual disk I want to install.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.940
ESX I can't.

03:43.430 --> 03:48.110
So I'm going to go ahead and choose the only virtual this that I have all choose my keyboard layout

03:48.230 --> 03:54.280
which in my case is U.S. default and I'll choose a root password.

03:54.380 --> 03:55.780
I'll go hide and hit enter.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
And now it's going to scan my system gather some additional information.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.870
It's going to confirm that I actually want to install ESX I on that partition that I've selected.

04:05.870 --> 04:10.400
So I'll go ahead and hit F 11 to continue the installation process.

04:12.980 --> 04:17.660
OK so now we can see that our installation has been completed.

04:17.650 --> 04:22.440
We've gone ahead and successfully installed the ESX operating system on the host.

04:22.550 --> 04:28.220
So I'm going to go ahead and hit enter to reboot the ESX I.

04:28.790 --> 04:32.690
And then I'm going to take you through the direct console user interface.

04:32.690 --> 04:42.580
So let's enter I'm also going to take a moment here to disconnect the CD drive from this virtual machine.

04:43.130 --> 04:50.990
So on this VM I'm going to go ahead and right click it and edit the settings of the virtual machine

04:51.050 --> 04:53.270
and essentially just remove the ISO image

04:56.090 --> 04:59.800
that will allow the ESX host to boot up now.

05:00.270 --> 05:08.600
OK so now that we have successfully installed ESX I I'm going to head off to and log in with the root

05:08.600 --> 05:12.120
credentials that we established during the installation.

05:12.230 --> 05:15.640
And here I am at the direct console user interface.

05:15.750 --> 05:22.880
So now at the DC UI direct console user interface I can go ahead and do things like change my password

05:23.450 --> 05:27.620
I can configure my management network for this particular host.

05:27.770 --> 05:30.410
I can restart the management network.

05:30.410 --> 05:37.130
I can look at logs I can do management network tasks things like that just to make sure that the host

05:37.130 --> 05:39.830
is actually working properly.

05:39.860 --> 05:47.480
So this is where you'll do kind of the very basic initial configuration of your ESX host.

05:47.480 --> 05:53.150
And once that's done you can go ahead and log into the center and add this host to your vse and our

05:53.150 --> 05:54.570
inventory.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.550
But that's as far as I'm going to go right now.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.560
So this is how we go ahead and install ESX II.

06:00.570 --> 06:01.760
Pretty straightforward right.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.070
The installation process is pretty easy.

06:04.070 --> 06:11.450
If you ever want to wipe out your configuration and reset it to like the factory default configuration

06:11.840 --> 06:15.410
that's what this final menu option of the DCU I can do.
