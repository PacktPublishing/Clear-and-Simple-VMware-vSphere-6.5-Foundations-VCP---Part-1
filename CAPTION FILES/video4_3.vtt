00:00.980 --> 00:08.030
In this video I'll break down the differences between NFL version 3 and NTFS version 4 it out one.

00:08.430 --> 00:16.920
And as of these fear of six and FS version for it one is now supported for our NFL status stores.

00:16.980 --> 00:23.780
So NFL for now one comes with some additional functionality that version 3 does not include.

00:23.820 --> 00:29.970
That being said there are also some limitations that are specific to NFL version for not one that you

00:29.970 --> 00:31.490
need to be aware of as well.

00:31.520 --> 00:31.870
Right.

00:31.980 --> 00:40.340
So number one with NFL version 3 storage traffic is strictly unencrypted.

00:40.350 --> 00:40.700
Right.

00:40.710 --> 00:51.990
So we can only use FS on networks that we 100 percent trust the other limiting factor is as you can

00:51.990 --> 00:58.490
see here there is only one IP address on our network attached storage device.

00:58.540 --> 01:11.710
So because of that the ESX host uses only one TCAP connection for I O to the FS storage device are only

01:11.710 --> 01:17.710
a single IP address can be used for the NFA server per data store and this can make a load balancing

01:17.710 --> 01:24.670
difficult because we typically use IP hash for load balancing this type of traffic.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.290
If we have the same IP for all of our traffic IP hashes Im going to do us any good.

01:34.640 --> 01:40.250
And the final limitation actually not really a limitation but more of our requirement is that with edifies

01:40.310 --> 01:48.500
version 3 the ESX host requires a root access to the server and this can become a little bit of an issue

01:48.530 --> 01:56.840
because many fast devices come with something called the root squash enabled which basically disallows

01:56.930 --> 02:00.040
remote attempts to connect to it as root.

02:00.050 --> 02:08.390
So that's just something to bear in mind with version 3 is that the ESX host must have root level access

02:08.660 --> 02:11.270
to the FS server.

02:11.300 --> 02:16.920
Ok so fast forward to his version for not one and some things have changed.

02:16.940 --> 02:24.860
Number one there is improved security because the headers of all of our and FS traffic are encrypted

02:24.860 --> 02:29.690
and signed and so we're not actually encrypting all of the storage traffic but we're encrypting all

02:29.690 --> 02:30.770
of the headers.

02:31.010 --> 02:33.360
So we have an improved level of security there.

02:33.440 --> 02:40.670
Also you'll notice a second IP address just appeared on my network attached storage device multipath

02:40.670 --> 02:44.870
thing is now supported using multiple IP addresses.

02:44.900 --> 02:53.750
And also we no longer need root level access with NFL version 4.1.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.810
The big downside version for that one is VHI is not supported.

02:59.190 --> 03:06.220
So if you're not familiar with VHI it's the VSE for API for Array integration.

03:06.840 --> 03:14.980
And what it allows you to do is carry out certain vse for type functions and NTFS version 3.

03:15.230 --> 03:15.440
Right.

03:15.510 --> 03:20.870
Things like creating Ficke provisioned disks rely on VHI

03:23.980 --> 03:31.660
so and as a result for not one we have Kerberos support included this is what actually removes the need

03:31.660 --> 03:33.220
for root level access.

03:33.400 --> 03:39.790
But what you need to do is make sure that all of your hosts use a matching set of credentials and to

03:39.790 --> 03:45.630
do this you'll utilize an active directory domain controller and key distribution center.

03:45.640 --> 03:54.490
One final item that I want to point out if you're currently using an FS version 3 and you want to create.

03:54.630 --> 04:02.720
I want to cut over two and a version for it out one you can not connect from one host using NFC version

04:02.720 --> 04:08.220
3 and another host using FS version for it out one to the same data store.

04:08.270 --> 04:14.780
As a matter of fact if you try to do that you can potentially corrupt the contents of that data store.

04:14.840 --> 04:22.040
So the best way to kind of make this transition to N.F. has for not one is to do it as a whole or you

04:22.040 --> 04:25.750
don't want half of your hosts on three and half of your hosts on 4.1.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.420
This is a this is kind of like a hard cut over.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.660
You want to get everything up to 4.1 simultaneously.

04:32.660 --> 04:36.650
That way there is no disparity between your ESX I hosts.
