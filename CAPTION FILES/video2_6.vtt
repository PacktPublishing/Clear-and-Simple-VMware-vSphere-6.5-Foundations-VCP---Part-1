In this video I'll demonstrate how to assign license keys to a fair sex environment using the Vee's

00:06.960 --> 00:08.790
for web client.

00:08.900 --> 00:14.450
So here you can see I've already logged into the vees faire web quiet and I'm going to go ahead and

00:14.450 --> 00:20.630
click on hosts and questers and one of the first things you'll notice when we get into the hosts and

00:20.630 --> 00:25.260
Klosters view is that my host is currently disconnected.

00:25.430 --> 00:29.360
I haven't ESX I host but but it's disconnected at the moment.

00:29.360 --> 00:35.390
And if we click on the summary for this host we can see the reason this host is disconnected from the

00:35.390 --> 00:40.830
center is the fact that the host license is expired.

00:41.060 --> 00:49.910
So when your host licenses expire and if using an evaluation license for example you will no longer

00:49.910 --> 00:55.340
be able to use the center to manage those ESX hosts.

00:55.340 --> 01:02.840
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually go to my administration screen and under administration

01:03.020 --> 01:06.040
I can go ahead and apply some license keys.

01:06.050 --> 01:13.700
So under administration I will click on license's and you can see here from IVI center Sharra.

01:13.830 --> 01:17.240
I've got a license that is currently expired.

01:17.340 --> 01:23.280
You can see from my hosts I've got a license that is currently expired.

01:23.420 --> 01:27.740
And so what I'm going to actually do is I'll start with the center.

01:27.740 --> 01:31.490
I'm going to Right-Click my V Center server and I'm going to sign a license.

01:31.970 --> 01:35.420
And here's my current license key that is expired.

01:35.420 --> 01:39.970
I'm going to go ahead and hit the plus button and add a new license key

01:43.020 --> 01:48.560
OK so I'm going to paste in my license key and you'll see this blurred out because I don't want to share

01:48.560 --> 01:54.980
my license with everybody and I'm going to simply call it the center six is the name of my license key

01:55.950 --> 01:59.230
and I'll finish.

01:59.320 --> 02:06.490
And now all apply this license key this new license key to my visa under sever so I'll choose the new

02:06.490 --> 02:08.310
V Center license key.

02:08.350 --> 02:10.320
Go ahead and head ok there.

02:10.450 --> 02:15.820
And now I can see that these are six is successfully license that the license expires in about a month

02:15.820 --> 02:23.530
or so and then I'm going to go to my hosts and I'm going to perform a similar process and I'll go to

02:23.530 --> 02:26.100
my host or click on to sign license.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.440
I'm going to click on the plus button to assign a new license key

02:33.870 --> 02:36.950
and I'll go ahead and paste my license key in.

02:37.350 --> 02:47.490
Next call it the sphere and our price plus that's my enterprise plus licensing key and I'll just call

02:47.490 --> 02:52.900
it licens 1 next and finish.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.240
And now I've got an appropriate license key that I can actually assign to this ESX I host that is not

02:59.240 --> 03:00.860
expired.

03:00.860 --> 03:08.960
I can also go to my licenses find the licenses that have currently expired Selecta those and had X to

03:08.960 --> 03:12.930
get rid of them just to keep my license inventory nice and clean.

03:13.220 --> 03:23.040
And now if I go back to hosts and Klosters my host is still disconnected and I can right click it and

03:23.040 --> 03:28.960
under connection go to connect and it should allow me to reconnect this host.

03:29.090 --> 03:29.880
And there we go.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.420
Now my ESX host has been reconnected.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.120
I can see my virtual machines.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.940
And now I can start to to this host because he has a valid license key.
