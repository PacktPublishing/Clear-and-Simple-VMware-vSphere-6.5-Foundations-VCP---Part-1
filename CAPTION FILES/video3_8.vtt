WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:06.810
In this video demonstrate some of the features of the sphere distributed switch and some of the policies

00:06.810 --> 00:08.140
that we can configure.

00:08.340 --> 00:15.110
Now some of these policies are also available on the VSE for standard switch.

00:15.120 --> 00:19.850
So I'll try to differentiate which features are available on both.

00:20.130 --> 00:26.840
But right now I'm really going to primarily focus on features that are only available on the VSE for

00:26.850 --> 00:28.550
distributed switch.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.870
So here we are.

00:30.970 --> 00:35.830
And the networking view of the Vee's for web client and I've clicked on my demo.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.500
For distributed twitch and I can see things like the properties.

00:40.580 --> 00:45.100
What the empty view is configured for that's an important property.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.450
What discovery protocol has been configured.

00:48.720 --> 00:54.890
And right now it's configured for CTP or Cisco discovery protocol.

00:55.420 --> 01:04.300
Now this is a feature that is available on both the VSE fair distributed and vse for standard virtual

01:04.300 --> 01:05.020
switches.

01:05.020 --> 01:17.950
CTP is supported on both and what CTP does for us is it allows us to actually discover and learn information

01:18.370 --> 01:22.650
about the physical switches that our hosts are connected to.

01:24.260 --> 01:24.460
Right.

01:24.480 --> 01:31.860
So this particular environment has to ESX host and each ESX I host has two physical adapters two physical

01:32.030 --> 01:40.150
even at ports CTP would allow me to look here on the Vee's for web client and see which switch ports

01:41.020 --> 01:42.210
they're connected to.

01:42.210 --> 01:47.740
Right and discover information about the physical switch that's supported on a standard switch in a

01:47.740 --> 01:48.940
distributed switch.

01:49.270 --> 01:55.060
And that is unique to Cisco switches Cisco discovery protocol is only supported by Cisco.

01:55.450 --> 02:03.610
If I have some other vendor then I can instead choose to use Lingpa Claire discovery protocol or Al

02:03.630 --> 02:05.620
LDP.

02:05.690 --> 02:13.470
Now this is an important one for the exam LDP is only supported by the vees fair distributed switch.

02:13.490 --> 02:14.120
That's it.

02:15.290 --> 02:21.730
So I can choose either one of those discovery protocols and enable them on the vees fair distributed

02:21.730 --> 02:23.710
switch.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.780
Here we can see my typology.

02:25.780 --> 02:29.580
I've got one virtual machine and I've got one physical adapter.

02:30.800 --> 02:39.610
On one host and one physical adapter and another host we can also configure link aggregation control

02:39.610 --> 02:49.390
protocol or elhi ECP what L.A. C.P. allows us to do is to bond multiple physical connections together

02:49.600 --> 02:55.360
and basically allow them to act as if they are one big physical connection.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.510
This is only available with the for distributed switch.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.160
And it's not available on TVs for standard virtual switch.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.950
And you can see here it's got all these different load balancing modes.

03:06.970 --> 03:12.440
How is that going to spread traffic across these physical adapters.

03:12.700 --> 03:17.980
And so what you'll do is you'll combine the physical adapters together into something called the link

03:18.040 --> 03:26.440
aggregation group or lag so we'll call it a lag and we're going to put two ports in this link aggregation

03:26.440 --> 03:30.220
group and we're going to go with a certain mode of LCP.

03:30.220 --> 03:33.620
Now this has to be supported by a physical switch.

03:33.700 --> 03:40.600
What you're basically doing is you're taking two or more physical adapters and you're telling your virtual

03:40.600 --> 03:44.650
switch and your physical switch to treat them as one big pipe.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.560
And you can see more on that and some of the other videos included with this course.

03:50.690 --> 03:57.360
But that's how you would go ahead and create a new link aggregation group for al-Asi P Here's our private

03:57.360 --> 04:03.930
villans again a feature that's only supported by the Vee's fair distributed which we have the ability

04:03.930 --> 04:07.010
to create a VPN within a violin.

04:07.320 --> 04:14.170
So here we can see on primary violin one maybe I want to establish some secondary valence right.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.710
Maybe I'll call this one.

04:15.750 --> 04:24.510
Secondary violin 101 and secondary V LAN to 0 1 and we'll make one of the community and we'll make one

04:24.510 --> 04:33.180
of them isolative what we're doing here when we create these private villans is we're basically establishing

04:33.180 --> 04:43.230
boundaries inside of the land one so I can hook up a bunch of virtual machines to primary Villon one

04:43.350 --> 04:47.180
secondary VLAN one and they'll all be able to communicate

04:50.630 --> 04:53.050
and they'll all be able to communicate just fine.

04:53.570 --> 05:01.070
I can also hook up a bunch of virtual machines to primary violin one secondary violin one to one

05:04.170 --> 05:10.300
let's add one more let's add secondary VLA and one or two as well which is also a community in

05:12.990 --> 05:13.580
OK.

05:13.820 --> 05:20.060
So I could take a bunch of Reems hook them up to primary veel and one secondary violin one to one and

05:20.060 --> 05:21.320
they'd all be able to communicate.

05:21.560 --> 05:26.750
I could do the same thing with primary Viola and one secondary violin and one or two.

05:26.750 --> 05:33.350
Those are community lands meaning anything within that community can talk.

05:33.480 --> 05:38.060
OK so just to recap what I've created here.

05:38.060 --> 05:43.180
Primary Villon one secondary veel and one this is promiscuous.

05:43.220 --> 05:50.840
It means anything that's connected to secondary Villon one can talk to anything else inside of Villon

05:50.840 --> 05:58.810
one including communities and isolated secondary violence the community villans are allowed to communicate

05:58.960 --> 06:01.740
with anything inside of their community.

06:02.750 --> 06:12.830
And anything in that promiscuous secondary Vueling the isolated secondary Villalon means they cannot

06:12.830 --> 06:14.160
communicate with each other.

06:14.180 --> 06:19.420
Right I could have 20 of them connected to the secondary isolated.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.230
They are not allowed to communicate.

06:21.350 --> 06:25.640
They can only communicate with the promiscuous feeling and that's it.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.720
So that's my private Vilain.

06:29.170 --> 06:35.890
And if we take a look at this test V.M. and go ahead and edit settings on it I'll show you how we can

06:35.890 --> 06:44.320
connect the virtual machine to one of those private villans right so you can see right now my virtual

06:44.320 --> 06:50.350
machine is connected to the distributed switch port group right which is actually exactly where I've

06:50.350 --> 06:53.610
just created those private secondary violence.

06:53.920 --> 07:01.800
And so if I go back to my Vee's for distributed switch I can now go ahead and create myself a Newport

07:01.870 --> 07:11.530
group which I'm going to call isolated I'll choose next and then I'll choose the and type and I'm going

07:11.530 --> 07:17.770
to make this support group with one of my private villans and I'm going to choose my isolated secondary

07:17.770 --> 07:18.670
Villalon.

07:18.910 --> 07:26.830
And now any virtual machines that I connect to that isolated poor group will not be able to communicate

07:26.830 --> 07:33.650
to anything other than the promiscuous secondary view in.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.670
So here is my network adapter.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.220
I can go ahead and change the network and connected to that isolated secondary violin.

07:43.620 --> 07:47.770
And now I've configured private violence on my Vee's fair distributed switch.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.670
OK let's take a look at some of the other settings that we can configure on the VSE for distributed

07:53.670 --> 07:54.040
switch.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.870
I can set up Netflix.

07:57.440 --> 08:05.420
So what net flow is going to do is it's going to allow me to establish an IP address of a net flow collector.

08:05.420 --> 08:10.420
So I'm going to go ahead and put in an address of an outflow collector in my environment here.

08:10.820 --> 08:17.970
And I also need to establish an IP address for the VSE fair distributed switch it's self so that it

08:17.970 --> 08:22.470
has the ability to communicate with the collector.

08:22.640 --> 08:30.860
And what it's essentially going to do is the Vee's for distributed which is going to send little summaries

08:31.010 --> 08:34.310
called flows to the net flow collector.

08:34.310 --> 08:40.670
For example if a virtual machine communicates with an e-mail server on a certain port and sends a certain

08:40.670 --> 08:48.260
amount of data it's going to summarize that traffic and send a traffic flow to the net flow collector.

08:48.570 --> 08:53.620
And it will continuously report all of the traffic that's going up.

08:53.920 --> 08:54.310
Right.

08:54.330 --> 09:03.350
So that this net flow collector will have a complete comprehensive history of all of these traffic patterns.

09:03.510 --> 09:09.800
And then I can use that net flow collector to do things like analysis for troubleshooting.

09:09.800 --> 09:16.260
All right so for example let's say that everybody says hey at o'clock on Monday everything always gets

09:16.260 --> 09:17.140
really slow.

09:18.060 --> 09:23.490
Well that's kind of hard to troubleshoot after the fact especially if the issue has gone away.

09:24.030 --> 09:30.570
But if you have a net flow collector you can go into it and say OK what was going on at two o'clock

09:30.570 --> 09:31.680
on Monday.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.130
Was there a lot of traffic happening.

09:34.230 --> 09:37.170
You know if not maybe it's some other sort of problem.

09:37.650 --> 09:43.760
So that's net flow and net flow is only available on the Vee's for distributed switch.

09:43.770 --> 09:50.050
Same with port mirroring port mirroring is only available on the Vee's for distributed switch.

09:50.610 --> 09:58.850
So here we can see there are a number of different port mirroring session types that you can establish.

09:59.090 --> 10:03.610
The most basic of which is a distributed port mirroring session.

10:03.890 --> 10:10.160
So we're a distributed port mirroring session is going to do is it's essentially going to take all of

10:10.160 --> 10:20.540
the traffic that is going to one of my ports on my virtual switch and mirror all of that traffic to

10:20.540 --> 10:22.140
a different port.

10:22.160 --> 10:29.480
So if you wanted to hook up let's say wireshark right and have it sit there and capture all the traffic

10:29.480 --> 10:36.270
that's going to one specific virtual machine you could do that using port mirroring right will now allow

10:36.270 --> 10:39.930
normal traffic on the ports that are being mirrored.

10:40.170 --> 10:42.300
And I'm going to go hadn't hit next here.

10:42.510 --> 10:48.160
And what we'll now do is just go ahead and choose what is the source port What's the destination port.

10:48.240 --> 10:53.440
Right now at the moment I've only got one virtual machine hooked up to this Vee's for distributed switch.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.230
But you can kind of get the idea right.

10:55.230 --> 11:01.230
I pick my source port here and then I'd go to the destination and I pick another poor.

11:01.230 --> 11:07.980
And all of this traffic that happened on the source port would be mirrored to the destination port.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.160
It would receive an identical copy of all that traffic.

11:12.160 --> 11:17.770
So if I'm using something like wireshark I can capture and analyze all of the traffic that's hitting

11:17.770 --> 11:19.060
a particular port.

11:19.420 --> 11:19.600
Right.

11:19.600 --> 11:24.400
And this is just one of the session types that are available to me.

11:24.490 --> 11:31.120
I could set up other Portmeirion sessions that can mirror traffic to an uplink port instead of one of

11:31.120 --> 11:38.470
my distributed ports or I could mirror traffic from a set of violence to a distributed port or it could

11:38.470 --> 11:43.850
even send my port mirrored traffic to a remote IP address.

11:43.870 --> 11:49.420
So there's a lot of different options here for those port mirroring Sessions again for the certification

11:49.420 --> 11:50.100
test.

11:50.110 --> 12:00.570
Remember allée C.P. private villans net flow port marrying and LDP or link where discovery protocol.

12:00.670 --> 12:09.720
Those are all only supported by the VSE for distributed switch another feature that is only supported

12:09.720 --> 12:14.190
by the vees fair distributed switch is health check.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.750
And by the way this is disabled by default.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.940
You'll see that it's disabled by default.

12:19.950 --> 12:21.380
That's a good thing right.

12:21.420 --> 12:29.550
Health check actually introduces a little bit of security vulnerability into your environment so you

12:29.550 --> 12:37.110
should only turn this on if you are maybe configuring a new physical switch or setting up a new ESX

12:37.110 --> 12:38.230
I host.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.090
And here's what health check is going to do.

12:40.170 --> 12:42.120
I'm going to go ahead and enable it.

12:42.730 --> 12:51.300
What health check is going to do is it's going to validate that the land and M2 settings and the teaming

12:51.300 --> 12:59.580
settings that you've configured on your physical ESX I host are actually compatible with what has been

12:59.580 --> 13:02.450
configured on the physical Ethernet switch.

13:03.390 --> 13:10.580
So that's kind of the goal here of of the health check is to basically validate.

13:10.620 --> 13:11.250
OK.

13:11.400 --> 13:20.010
You know what we've configured on this particular ESX I host actually matches up to two what we've configured

13:20.630 --> 13:22.960
on the physical switches self.

13:22.980 --> 13:23.250
Right.

13:23.250 --> 13:32.180
So if we look at for example the switch 0 there is going to be settings in here like MT you or there's

13:32.220 --> 13:39.300
going to be settings on the port groups like for example if you look at VM network it's got a really

13:39.300 --> 13:40.260
an identifier.

13:40.320 --> 13:45.780
If those villans don't match what's on the physical switch if the empty you doesn't match what's on

13:45.780 --> 13:47.670
the physical switch.

13:47.670 --> 13:54.360
If my nic teaming method isn't a good match for what the physical switches configured for we're going

13:54.360 --> 13:56.740
to find out about all of that information right here.

13:59.440 --> 14:03.230
OK so let's go ahead and jump back to our Wii's for distributed switch.

14:03.430 --> 14:07.810
The final feature that I want to show you here is network IO control.

14:07.810 --> 14:12.330
So you can see at the moment network IO control is enabled.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.270
We're running network control version 3.

14:15.490 --> 14:22.580
And what it's doing is it's basically prioritizing all of the different types of system traffic.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.110
Right.

14:23.380 --> 14:30.170
So we've got fault tolerance logging management traffic and a fast virtual machine traffic itself.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.190
The actual traffic that my venoms are generating.

14:33.190 --> 14:36.760
I scuzzy right the motion all these different types of traffic.

14:37.270 --> 14:44.950
And what is essentially doing is it's saying OK you know VM traffic has 100 shares where as I scuzzy

14:44.950 --> 14:47.680
traffic only has 50.

14:47.730 --> 14:57.310
So if there is bandwidth contention that's the only time these shares are enforced.

14:57.310 --> 15:04.640
I mean if my physical adapters are congested if they're running low on bandwidth what will happen is

15:04.640 --> 15:10.950
network control will give twice as much bandwidth to virtual machine traffic as it will give to ice

15:11.030 --> 15:17.550
Gussie and I can modify all these and I can say you know what for I scuzzy I want to go ahead and give

15:17.550 --> 15:18.860
a high number of shares right.

15:18.870 --> 15:19.960
I want to make it.

15:20.260 --> 15:21.830
It's really important right.

15:21.840 --> 15:29.080
Maybe I even want to go as far as reserving 50 megabits per second of bandwidth right.

15:30.080 --> 15:35.750
And maybe for things like Wii motion traffic or let's let's go these for replication.

15:35.750 --> 15:38.030
Right maybe for VSE for replication.

15:38.030 --> 15:41.740
I want to say OK you know what I'm going to set a limit right.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.850
I have set a limit here.

15:42.860 --> 15:50.210
I don't want these for replication ever consuming more than 75 megabits per second of bandwidth so I'll

15:50.210 --> 15:56.930
go ahead and set a limit there and maybe I'll even Also go ahead and edit this and I'll give it a low

15:56.930 --> 15:58.460
priority.

15:58.460 --> 16:06.530
So that way if bandwidth contention does occur everything else will be prioritized over the Wii's for

16:06.530 --> 16:09.060
replication traffic.

16:09.220 --> 16:11.100
And that's what network IO control is right.

16:11.110 --> 16:21.520
It's essentially share's limits and reservations that are applied to bandwidth of my actual physical

16:21.560 --> 16:24.140
VM next.

16:24.390 --> 16:28.050
And I can also create network resource pools.

16:28.110 --> 16:32.570
So let's go ahead and create a network resource pool I'm going to call it that work resource pool 1.

16:32.790 --> 16:37.610
And my description is going to be high priority.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.050
I'm not going to give it any reservation.

16:40.210 --> 16:44.650
So now I've created a network resource pool it's called network resource pool 1.

16:44.980 --> 16:53.550
And what I can do is I can utilize this to control the bandwidth for my distributed poor groups.

16:53.740 --> 17:00.970
I can go ahead and associate distributed groups with this network resource pool and go ahead and do

17:00.970 --> 17:06.840
things like Reserve bandwidth for those special distributed groups that are really important.

17:06.850 --> 17:13.360
So maybe I'll give this network resource pool a reservation of 50 megabits per second and then all the

17:13.360 --> 17:17.600
associated distributed poorer group with the network resource pool.

17:17.860 --> 17:20.150
In this case I'm not actually going to do that.

17:20.170 --> 17:24.280
I'm actually going to delete this network resource pool before I forget it's there.

17:24.550 --> 17:24.960
OK.
