00:02.950 --> 00:10.410
And this video we'll learn about the center update manager and how it can be used to keep ESX hosts

00:10.500 --> 00:17.810
virtual machines VM are tools virtual hardware versions and all of those sorts of via VM where vs fair

00:17.820 --> 00:19.020
specific components.

00:19.020 --> 00:27.780
Up to date that's the purpose of update manager is to perform patches and upgrades for VSE fair components.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.860
Automate Patchen version management for VSE fair.

00:30.990 --> 00:37.460
It supports ESX I host virtual machines and virtual appliances and it must be registered with the VSE

00:37.460 --> 00:38.190
center server.

00:38.190 --> 00:44.240
Now some of this is going to get a little bit different as we delve into these spheres 6.5.

00:44.400 --> 00:49.470
But if you're running the Windows version of the center you can go ahead and install update manager

00:49.590 --> 00:51.640
right on that same machine.

00:51.870 --> 00:56.910
So if you're running the center on a Windows virtual machine you can install update manager right on

00:56.910 --> 00:58.430
that same virtual machine.

00:59.580 --> 01:08.190
If you're deploying the center server appliance version 6.5 it's bundled directly with the center server

01:08.190 --> 01:10.680
appliance you don't have to install anything.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.790
So really easy to manage.

01:12.810 --> 01:16.350
Everything is manageable right through the web client and 6.5.

01:16.560 --> 01:24.320
So 6.5 is a big step forward for update manager versus prior versions that it's 100 percent web Klein

01:24.330 --> 01:32.840
integrated 100 percent bundled with the VSE center server appliance and of course keeping your environment

01:32.840 --> 01:39.950
properly updated and properly patched mitigates a number of risks by reducing vulnerabilities and by

01:39.950 --> 01:41.710
providing bug fixes.

01:41.780 --> 01:47.480
So let's take a look at how Vee's centers update manager works.

01:47.480 --> 01:51.840
And here we've got the V Center server appliance on the right.

01:51.840 --> 01:59.510
With Update Manager baked right into it it's built right in and then on the left we have our center

01:59.510 --> 02:00.060
inventory.

02:00.080 --> 02:08.050
They've got some ESX I hosts that are part of a cluster and we've got virtual machines.

02:08.190 --> 02:13.970
One of the first things that we need to establish with our center server is download sources and there's

02:13.980 --> 02:16.510
a couple that are built right into it by default.

02:16.680 --> 02:22.800
But just think of your download sources as anywhere that you need to download patches and updates from.

02:22.920 --> 02:28.920
For example you know we have critical host updates and non-critical host updates we need to get those

02:28.920 --> 02:30.050
from VM Ware.

02:30.090 --> 02:38.710
So that's our download source for those particular patches as VM were and those patches will become

02:38.710 --> 02:41.210
part of a baseline.

02:41.280 --> 02:49.120
Right so here we see the critical host updates baseline and that includes any patches that VM or deems

02:49.140 --> 02:51.300
are critical host updates.

02:51.360 --> 02:58.680
Right that's what we call a dynamic baseline a dynamic baseline is one that automatically gets updated

02:58.680 --> 03:02.010
with new patches or a fixed baseline.

03:02.220 --> 03:07.610
That's a specific set of patches that does not change unless we manually change it.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.550
So we've got our baseline right.

03:11.540 --> 03:20.530
Our critical host updates baseline and we now need to actually attach that baseline to objects.

03:20.910 --> 03:25.350
So we're going to attach it to our cluster of ESX hosts.

03:25.530 --> 03:32.370
I could attach it to my hosts individually or attach at once to the entire quarter and that will allow

03:32.370 --> 03:35.850
me to apply that baseline across the entire cluster.

03:36.150 --> 03:39.540
And at that point I have the ability to scan that cluster.

03:39.620 --> 03:39.810
Right.

03:39.810 --> 03:48.900
So when we scan it's going to expose which patches are already installed and what you're not and what

03:48.900 --> 03:56.390
you'll see an update manager is that we'll come back and say this host is not complying it it that means

03:56.660 --> 04:00.540
this host is missing some of the stuff that's in this baseline.

04:00.580 --> 04:02.860
It doesn't mean that they're not compatible.

04:03.200 --> 04:10.520
If they're not compatible it'll tell you that I will say not compatible not compliant means this host

04:10.730 --> 04:13.170
could use some of the stuff that's in the space line.

04:13.450 --> 04:13.860
Right.

04:13.910 --> 04:20.150
So after we scan our host to see which patches they have and which patches they don't we can then remediate

04:20.570 --> 04:23.140
and push out those updates.

04:23.650 --> 04:27.100
And like I mentioned there's a few different types of baselines right.

04:27.110 --> 04:37.430
We've got an upgrade baseline for example upgrading a host from ESX 5.5 to ESX a 6 or 6 to 6.5 we can

04:37.430 --> 04:39.960
upgrade virtual hardware or VM or tools.

04:40.130 --> 04:48.050
And then we've got dynamic in fixed patch baselines and like I mentioned on the previous slide those

04:48.050 --> 04:55.160
dynamic baselines will change on the fly as do patches come out whereas fix have to be manually modified

04:56.540 --> 05:03.740
and then if you've got additional drivers for example that you need to to install you can use an extension

05:03.740 --> 05:04.470
baseline.

05:04.520 --> 05:04.720
Right.

05:04.730 --> 05:13.550
So for example let's say you have a Cisco U.S.'s blade server that requires a specific storage Dr. I

05:13.550 --> 05:20.190
can't install that on a group of hosts using update manager and an extension baseline.

05:20.270 --> 05:21.750
It's an add on of six.

05:21.860 --> 05:30.630
It's an extension to the ESX I image.

05:30.650 --> 05:31.580
All right.

05:31.900 --> 05:38.170
So now we've learned a little bit about Update Manager and we understand that we can use update manager

05:38.170 --> 05:47.620
to update or even upgrade our ESX hosts but our ESX I host those are our physical servers and we have

05:47.620 --> 05:51.830
many virtual machines running on those ESX I hosts.

05:51.850 --> 06:00.580
And so if update manager starts working on performing some sort of upgrade or patching it might need

06:00.580 --> 06:02.030
to reboot those hosts.

06:04.510 --> 06:06.400
And we don't want this to be service impacting.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.040
We don't want our victims to go down.

06:08.410 --> 06:16.130
So one of the beautiful things about Update Manager is the fact that it is integrated with distributed

06:16.220 --> 06:26.380
resource scheduler or diarists So update manager will actually leverage Diyar diyas to ensure that there

06:26.380 --> 06:29.800
is no service impact during our updates.

06:29.810 --> 06:38.390
So for example here is our critical host updates baseline and I've attached that baseline to these hosts

06:38.570 --> 06:45.410
that are part of a cluster and I am now scanning those hosts for compliance with that baseline.

06:45.410 --> 06:52.880
And look at that both hosts are imaging missing patch to both hosts or missing patch 2.

06:52.910 --> 06:56.790
So these hosts are not compliant with my baseline.

06:57.110 --> 07:01.230
And at this point I can choose to remediate those hosts.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.460
I can choose to install those patches.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.250
And what you will do is this.

07:06.410 --> 07:11.970
Let's say that ESX 0 2 gets remediated first well is x.

07:11.970 --> 07:18.730
0 2 is going to have to get rebooted and before it can get rebooted it needs to enter what we call maintenance

07:18.730 --> 07:19.240
mode.

07:21.380 --> 07:27.860
If you put a host into maintenance mode what that essentially means is no virtual machines can run on

07:27.860 --> 07:29.350
this host.

07:29.510 --> 07:34.660
Its in maintenance mode it should be able to power it off without creating any problems.

07:36.110 --> 07:43.130
So if I have a host that currently has virtual machines running on it like ESX C02 does in this picture

07:44.250 --> 07:51.210
if I try to place that host into maintenance mode the IRS is going to recognize that thats going to

07:51.210 --> 07:59.370
say hey they're trying to put ESX C02 in maintenance mode lets evacuate all of these Reems migrate them

07:59.400 --> 08:05.410
to other hosts first then the host gets placed into maintenance mode.

08:06.650 --> 08:11.180
And then all of our patching and updates or whatever needs to get done can get done.

08:11.180 --> 08:17.360
It can reboot and it won't affect any virtual machines and when it's done the host simply will come

08:17.360 --> 08:21.070
out of maintenance mode and the next host will continue right.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.920
ESX 01 will get patched next.

08:23.960 --> 08:29.300
When that host is placed in maintenance mode the VMS will be evacuated back to ESX zero or two

08:32.840 --> 08:37.310
so that's pretty cool because it means that you can run updates even in the middle of the day if you

08:37.310 --> 08:38.020
want right.

08:38.050 --> 08:43.700
If you've got your Wii motion network solve all figured out and there's no incompatibilities and everything's

08:43.860 --> 08:50.030
like figured out in good shape you could run update manager in the middle of the day and go and let

08:50.030 --> 08:52.420
it update all your hosts with no downtime.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.810
Or you can also schedule remediation with an update manager.

08:56.810 --> 08:59.440
So if you want to happen at midnight you can do that right.

08:59.450 --> 09:01.840
It's no problem you can schedule remediation as well.

09:04.110 --> 09:04.650
All right.

09:04.690 --> 09:12.460
So Update Manager centralizes and automates patch and version management for VSE fair on ESX I host

09:12.460 --> 09:18.550
virtual machines and virtual appliances on your VM that can update VM our tools and I can update the

09:18.550 --> 09:19.850
virtual hardware version

09:22.590 --> 09:29.460
update manager uses baselines which are collections of patches or upgrades or possibly host extensions

09:29.520 --> 09:31.650
that can be applied.

09:31.900 --> 09:39.540
And then we can scan our objects for compliance with Update Manager update manager is built right into

09:39.540 --> 09:46.860
the V Center server appliance as of these fair 6.5 and we have are three different types of baselines.

09:46.900 --> 09:54.210
We have patches upgrades and extensions and patch baselines can be either fixed or dynamic.
