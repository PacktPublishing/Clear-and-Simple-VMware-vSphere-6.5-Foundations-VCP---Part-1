In this video I'll explain Fiber Channel 1 masking So all the vices in a fiber channel network are identified

00:08.470 --> 00:17.470
by a address called the Worldwide name and we can mask which Lund's will be presented to each host based

00:17.470 --> 00:19.540
on this worldwide name.

00:19.540 --> 00:28.240
So for example let's take a look on the left hand side at our production ESX host and we want to give

00:28.600 --> 00:32.880
this Prod. ESX host access to the Prod. lun.

00:33.070 --> 00:39.770
But we don't want to give it access to the D'Evelyn and these loans are on the same storage array.

00:39.770 --> 00:42.170
So zoning will not help us here.

00:43.610 --> 00:49.940
So here we see we want to give this production ESX host access to the production line and we can do

00:49.940 --> 00:56.570
so based on the worldwide name we can configure that in the fiber channel storage array which worldwide

00:56.570 --> 01:03.140
names should have access to which lungs and whether they should have read write Read-Only or no access

01:04.610 --> 01:12.040
so I could grant that particular World-Wide name no access on the Devlin and forbit it from accessing

01:12.040 --> 01:13.430
that particular volume.
