00:03.150 --> 00:08.100
In this video I'll demonstrate how to create and if has data store.

00:08.330 --> 00:14.260
So let's start by looking at my first host here hosts 12 I'll call it.

00:14.630 --> 00:20.320
And on the host I'm going to click on the datasource tab and you can see here I have a data store called

00:20.360 --> 00:30.860
Big and my big data store is an FS version 3 data store and it's got about 650 megs of available space

00:31.020 --> 00:31.460
right.

00:31.640 --> 00:38.480
So I've got this data store that's that's already open that's already created and available on my first

00:38.540 --> 00:39.720
ESX I host.

00:39.840 --> 00:46.220
And if I click on settings I can see some of the settings for this particular data store and I can take

00:46.220 --> 00:52.470
a look at specifically the device backing and this is what I want to show you.

00:52.490 --> 01:03.350
So the NFC server itself is one two dot 168 dot 1 1997 and there was a folder created on that and FS

01:03.410 --> 01:06.740
system that is being shared.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.200
Right.

01:07.400 --> 01:14.240
And that's the important thing that we always have to keep in mind with an FS right in this case we're

01:14.240 --> 01:17.750
not creating a VMA fast data store.

01:17.830 --> 01:21.140
There is no VMI fast file system when it comes to NFL.

01:21.140 --> 01:30.180
Right the NFL has its own file system and we're simply accessing a shared folder on that file system.

01:33.270 --> 01:39.540
So let's take a look at the second host host 13 and you can see that it does not have that data store

01:39.540 --> 01:44.480
called big.

01:44.550 --> 01:50.160
So I am now going to add a new data store to the second ESX I was going to call it an NFL data store

01:51.090 --> 01:52.620
because that's what it's going to be.

01:52.740 --> 01:58.040
And I want to make sure that I'm very careful here with this selection.

01:58.110 --> 02:05.130
I want to choose the same and a fast version across all of my ESX I hosts if some hosts are accessing

02:05.130 --> 02:12.990
NF as data store on has version 3 and other hosts are using N.F. as Version 4 not one we can potentially

02:12.990 --> 02:16.080
corrupt the contents of that data store.

02:16.140 --> 02:23.190
So we're going to be really careful here and make sure we're choosing the same version of FS consistently

02:24.400 --> 02:26.540
and I'm going to call this data store demo.

02:26.690 --> 02:31.230
It's going to be on the $192 168 199.

02:31.620 --> 02:42.230
Seven is my first device and now I'll put in the folder that is being shared by my and FS system.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.130
And I'll go ahead and hit next and finish.

02:47.410 --> 02:48.720
And that's really all there is to it.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.440
Right when you're saying I've been NFL data store it is basically Tallaght What's the address of the

02:53.690 --> 02:55.420
FS device.

02:55.600 --> 03:00.850
What's the folder that's being shared and do I want to access it in read only or read right.

03:00.850 --> 03:02.310
So go ahead and hit finish here.

03:03.450 --> 03:08.530
And we should see my data store appear almost instantaneously.

03:08.670 --> 03:09.040
Right.

03:09.210 --> 03:14.720
Because we're not dealing with VM FS that data store does not need to be formatted.

03:14.730 --> 03:16.370
We're not using a lawn.

03:16.390 --> 03:20.970
There is no raw disk space that needs to be formatted with the NFL.

03:20.970 --> 03:24.710
We're accessing a file system that has already been created.

03:26.980 --> 03:27.430
OK.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.540
So in host 13 I've got my demo data store I host 12.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.240
I've got my big data store.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.950
So the hosts don't really match up just yet.

03:36.090 --> 03:36.270
Right.

03:36.280 --> 03:40.820
Some of them have one data store while other hosts have a number.

03:41.070 --> 03:41.720
Right.

03:41.740 --> 03:49.590
So let's go ahead and go to my big data store here under storage and look at hosts.

03:49.600 --> 03:57.320
And here you can see this data store is available to host 192 dot 168 that won 99 out 12.

03:57.610 --> 04:01.570
This data store is available to host 13 right.

04:01.720 --> 04:06.240
And so that's what I have available on my hosts right.

04:06.250 --> 04:11.110
I've configured these data stores to be available on certain hosts.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.740
So what I can do here is I'm going to click on my big data store I'm actually going to right click it

04:15.950 --> 04:19.580
and I'm going to choose to mount it to additional hosts.

04:19.580 --> 04:24.500
And now I can make this data store that's already created available to other house.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.480
I'll do the same thing with demo.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.940
Right click it.

04:27.950 --> 04:31.550
Mount data store two additional hosts and choose host 12.

04:31.910 --> 04:38.870
And so now if I click on my demo data store it's available on both hosts if I click on my big data store

04:39.260 --> 04:46.340
it's available on both hosts and since I have shared storage that's available across my two ESX I host.
