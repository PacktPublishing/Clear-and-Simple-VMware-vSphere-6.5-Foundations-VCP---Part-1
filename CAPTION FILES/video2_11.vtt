00:03.230 --> 00:10.370
In this video we'll take a look at Update Manager and vse fair 6.5 and in my lab environment here I've

00:10.370 --> 00:16.520
actually deployed the recentre server appliance which comes with Update Manager built right in.

00:17.180 --> 00:25.280
So I'm going to start by going to hosts and Klosters and here you can see I've won ESX I host that is

00:25.280 --> 00:28.570
currently being managed by this vse center server.

00:28.730 --> 00:33.570
And when we go to our ESX host we have a series of tabs here on the right.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.760
And one of those tabs is the update manager tab.

00:37.880 --> 00:46.140
And so here we can see the status of update manager as it relates to this specific host.

00:46.240 --> 00:53.640
I can click on the go to admin view on and manage update manager as a whole.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.310
Right so that's what I'm going to do here.

00:56.230 --> 00:57.820
So I'm going to click on manage.

00:57.820 --> 01:01.000
And here we can see all of the settings for Update Manager.

01:01.000 --> 01:01.570
Right.

01:01.690 --> 01:07.740
Like for example where are we going to store the patches for ESX II hosts.

01:07.750 --> 01:15.460
We can modify our download settings like for example where are we going to download new patches and

01:15.460 --> 01:22.990
updates and do we want to edit these download sources and add additional downloads sources for maybe

01:22.990 --> 01:26.230
third party solutions.

01:26.290 --> 01:30.370
How often do we want to download new patches.

01:30.460 --> 01:37.510
So do we want to enable a scheduled download and you can see here the next time that my patch downloads

01:37.510 --> 01:45.820
are going to run is it 4:29 but we can change those scheduling options if we want to.

01:46.030 --> 01:54.290
We can also set up our notification checks like how often is Update Manager going to check for recalled

01:54.310 --> 01:59.110
patches or that's what notification checks are.

01:59.460 --> 02:06.690
And then we can change some other settings like our VM settings do we want a snapshot VM prior to remediation

02:06.720 --> 02:08.840
so that we can roll back.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.960
Do we want to automatically turn off.

02:11.970 --> 02:14.640
Distributed power management.

02:14.910 --> 02:16.780
Do we want to turn off high availability.

02:16.800 --> 02:21.200
Mission Control where we've got all these different cluster settings that we can modify as well.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.790
And here we can see the current host baseline.

02:26.820 --> 02:33.270
And these are a couple of baselines that come built right in the noncritical host patches and the critical

02:33.570 --> 02:36.360
hosta patches.

02:36.800 --> 02:43.750
So what I want to do right now is download the very latest patches for both of these baselines.

02:43.780 --> 02:46.170
I can see right now they have no content.

02:46.520 --> 02:53.940
And so I want to go ahead and download all of the latest patches for both of these dynamic baselines.

02:54.020 --> 03:02.740
That way I have them and now I can go ahead and actually run these patches against my ESX host.

03:03.210 --> 03:08.640
So I'm going to go back to this download settings screen and I'm going to click on the download now

03:08.640 --> 03:17.400
button and allow these baselines these dynamic baselines to get updated in that way will know we have

03:17.400 --> 03:19.430
all of the latest patches here.

03:19.480 --> 03:27.060
I'm just going to pin this and unpinned this to give myself a little bit more space to work with and

03:27.060 --> 03:34.190
that I can look at recent tasks and monitor the progress of this patch and definition's download.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.860
So I'm going to pause my recording for a moment while this is completing.

03:40.910 --> 03:48.290
OK so I've just resumed my recording and now we can see here that I have a number of noncritical and

03:48.290 --> 03:50.070
critical patches.

03:50.270 --> 03:57.050
So my patch definition download worked and I was able to update these two baselines.

03:57.410 --> 04:04.180
So I'm going to go back to the hosts and cluster screen and from there I'm going to go ahead to this

04:04.190 --> 04:12.940
ESX I host and I'm going to attach a baseline to it so I'll just click on the attached baseline button

04:14.440 --> 04:22.460
and I'll go ahead and attach the critical and non-critical host patches baselines to this ESX I host

04:22.940 --> 04:25.930
and then I'm going to go ahead and scan for updates.

04:26.170 --> 04:34.660
So what we've basically done as I've said you know for these two hosts we want to figure out if there

04:34.660 --> 04:39.490
are patches included in these baselines that these hosts need.

04:39.670 --> 04:44.980
Right so we're going to attach the baselines to the hosts and then we're actually going to scan the

04:44.980 --> 04:53.800
ESX host to see which of these patches are required for this particular ESX host and what to expect

04:53.800 --> 04:54.170
we'll see.

04:54.160 --> 05:02.260
Here is the compliance status will come back as not compliant meaning there are some patches that need

05:02.260 --> 05:04.920
to be installed on this ESX host.

05:04.930 --> 05:10.540
So I've got a little bit of a problem here it's saying the host cannot download files from the update

05:10.540 --> 05:17.410
manager or patch store so there must be something wrong with the network connectivity here between my

05:17.470 --> 05:24.130
ESX I host and the patch store so I'm going to actually troubleshoot that issue and when I come back

05:24.220 --> 05:27.670
to the recording here I'll explain what I did to fix it.

05:28.000 --> 05:28.560
OK.

05:28.660 --> 05:35.590
So as it turned out my DNS server was down and I'll definitely do it because of the DNS server isn't

05:35.590 --> 05:36.340
working.

05:36.340 --> 05:41.120
The ESX I host will not be able to resolve this address.

05:41.170 --> 05:44.790
Right here we have an address defined for a Visa Center.

05:44.830 --> 05:49.480
And if my DNS server isn't working that address is going to be unresolvable.

05:49.480 --> 05:56.890
So I just booted my DNS server back up and now I'm going to try to scan for updates one more time just

05:56.890 --> 06:01.870
to make sure that it actually works and still presenting that error to me here.

06:02.020 --> 06:09.520
I'll just go ahead and hit OK and we'll give it a moment and hopefully now that the DNS server is back

06:09.520 --> 06:12.590
up and running this will work OK and we're all set.

06:12.610 --> 06:13.570
It's completed.

06:13.570 --> 06:16.700
So we have now scanned for remediation.

06:16.870 --> 06:22.560
And as you can actually see I've installed the latest version of ESX eye on this host.

06:22.570 --> 06:25.500
So it's actually compliant with all the latest patches.

06:25.510 --> 06:25.720
Right.

06:25.720 --> 06:31.450
If I go to the summary of the host I can see the build number here and we are on the current build at

06:31.450 --> 06:32.590
the moment.

06:32.590 --> 06:39.300
So that's what we would expect to see with Update Manager if we're scanning against a dynamic baseline

06:39.400 --> 06:42.480
like this and the hosts are already up to date.

06:42.550 --> 06:49.790
Now that being said I do want to actually remediate something during the course of this video.

06:50.110 --> 06:56.700
So let's walk through another situation in which we might use Update Manager Okay.

06:56.750 --> 07:02.870
So now what I want to actually do at this point is go back to my hosts and Klosters veel And what I'm

07:02.870 --> 07:07.510
going to do is actually go ahead and import a virtual machine.

07:07.610 --> 07:08.300
Right.

07:08.300 --> 07:14.000
And the reason I'm going to do this is because of the fact that you know we don't have to apply any

07:14.000 --> 07:21.610
patches to this host but host aren't the only place where we can use update manager to apply patches.

07:21.860 --> 07:29.070
OK so here we have an older virtual machine that's actually an old version of virtual hardware and so

07:29.070 --> 07:35.720
I'm going to go ahead and attach a baseline to it and I'm going to upgrade the virtual machine hardware

07:36.340 --> 07:42.890
to the latest version so that it will match the hardware version of the ESX I host and then I'm going

07:42.890 --> 07:45.500
to go ahead and scan this VM for updates.

07:45.530 --> 07:50.480
I'll go ahead and just ignore VM more tools and virtual appliance and I'm just going to scan it for

07:50.480 --> 07:55.510
VM hardware updates and see if it could use an update.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.610
And here's the status that I expected to see.

07:58.840 --> 07:59.170
Right.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.590
It's noncompliant.

08:00.590 --> 08:03.840
The current version of the virgin machine is 11.

08:04.010 --> 08:06.980
The target version is 13.

08:06.980 --> 08:12.080
So I'm going to go ahead and click on and remediate and resolve this issue.

08:12.110 --> 08:19.040
I get this virtual machine upgraded to the latest version of virtual hardware and if I want to I could

08:19.040 --> 08:20.140
run it right away.

08:20.510 --> 08:23.710
I could schedule that to happen later on tonight.

08:23.780 --> 08:26.570
I'm going to go ahead and let it happen right away.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.550
I could take a snapshot of the virtual machine.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.310
I'm not going to do this in this case.

08:31.310 --> 08:39.470
But the main recommendation I would have for you here is if you do decide to take a snapshot set this

08:39.470 --> 08:42.640
threshold to automatically delete the snapshot.

08:42.840 --> 08:46.350
Now you don't want to accidentally leave old snapshots hanging out.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.930
So I'm going to go ahead and leave that at the saying I don't want to take a snapshot there and I'll

08:50.930 --> 08:57.890
finish and I'll allow update manager to actually go ahead and remediate this virtual machine and it's

08:57.890 --> 08:58.690
done right.

08:58.730 --> 09:02.920
So now my virtual machine is on a hardware version 13 which was the target version.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.500
So I've upgraded this VM to the latest virtual hardware.
