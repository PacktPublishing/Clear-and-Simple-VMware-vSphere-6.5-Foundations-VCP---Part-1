00:01.890 --> 00:08.880
In this video we'll learn about how the ESX host finds out about the ones that are available on the

00:08.880 --> 00:09.680
storage right.

00:11.010 --> 00:18.090
And with eyes because we have a method called Dynamic discovery that it can use to learn about the ones

00:18.510 --> 00:21.100
that are being presented to it by the storage array.

00:21.540 --> 00:28.810
So the first step of this process is to configure our ESX host with an IP address.

00:28.830 --> 00:35.520
We want to provide the host the IP address of the storage array so that it will have the ability to

00:35.520 --> 00:37.560
query the storage array.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.750
And this is called the scuzzy target.

00:40.770 --> 00:48.870
So notice on our ESX host side we have now this black box that's appeared and it specified the ICRC

00:48.990 --> 00:55.420
target is 10 not one not one to 10 which is the IP address of the storage processor on the array.

00:56.900 --> 01:04.370
Right so what we're telling our ESX I hosed is when we do a rescanned reach out to the storage array

01:04.430 --> 01:06.290
and discover new lines.

01:06.430 --> 01:13.880
Right and that's what a rescan operation does in the ESX I host it generates what's called a send target's

01:13.880 --> 01:15.810
request.

01:15.990 --> 01:22.460
And this is basically a request from the ESX I host saying Tell me about your Lund's.

01:22.570 --> 01:29.010
Would you have available what ones can I use to create a vm a fast data store and the storage array

01:29.010 --> 01:35.720
will respond with this and Target's response which is essentially just a listing of its Lund's Here's

01:35.760 --> 01:38.310
all the ones that I now have available.

01:38.670 --> 01:46.850
So now the ESX host has a list of basically chunks of an formatted disk space.

01:46.860 --> 01:47.060
Right.

01:47.060 --> 01:48.730
That's what these lines are.

01:48.780 --> 01:57.180
These are big chunks of disk space that are available to it that it can connect to and that it can format

01:57.570 --> 02:03.850
with VM fs so that it can store virtual machine files on them.

02:03.930 --> 02:04.200
Right.

02:04.280 --> 02:10.560
And any loans that are currently in use will be automatically filtered out.

02:11.060 --> 02:17.380
So there's something called Storage filters in the ESX host and it won't actually present you lawn's

02:17.420 --> 02:18.840
that are already in use.

02:18.860 --> 02:25.480
So if I now decide hey I want to create a new VM a fast data store and I look at my listing of available

02:25.480 --> 02:31.520
ones it's only going to show me the ones that don't currently have a data store created on that

02:36.480 --> 02:37.760
one more side note.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.090
And this is a good thing to remember for the exam.

02:41.550 --> 02:45.930
You can configure chap authentication with ice Gazi.

02:46.390 --> 02:50.340
So what you can do is you can configure even mutual authentication.

02:50.550 --> 02:57.660
And the purpose of chap is basically when the ESX host wants to connect to the eyes because the storage

02:57.660 --> 03:04.110
are right it has to send what's called a chap secret basically a password to the scuzzy array.

03:04.100 --> 03:04.350
Right.

03:04.380 --> 03:10.740
And that way the I scuzz the storage array can validate that yes this ESX I host is legitimate.

03:10.740 --> 03:17.730
It's not some fake host that somebody spinning up and then you can also require the scuzzy array to

03:17.730 --> 03:20.960
actually authenticate with the ESX I host as well.

03:20.970 --> 03:29.460
This is called mutuel chap authentication and it's a security tool that basically allows the host and

03:29.460 --> 03:37.080
the storage array to validate that both of those devices are legitimate devices that should be paired

03:37.080 --> 03:38.030
up with.

03:38.130 --> 03:42.920
This is the only storage solution that supports chap authentication.

03:42.930 --> 03:48.080
So that's an important item to keep in mind as you prepare to take your certification exam.
